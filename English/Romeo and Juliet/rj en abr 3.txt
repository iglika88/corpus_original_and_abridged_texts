
ACT I 


7 

PROLOGUE  
Two households, both alike in dignity, 
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, 
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, 
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. 
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes 
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; 
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows 
Do with their death bury their parents' strife. 
 
SCENE 1 
Verona. A public place. 
Enter SAMPSON and PETER, of the house of Capulet  
PETER 
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. 
SAMPSON 
'Tis all one. 
PETER 
Draw thy tool! here comes 
two of the house of the Montagues. 
SAMPSON 
Quarrel, I will back thee. 
PETER 
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as 
they list. 
SAMPSON 
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; 
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it. 
 Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR 
ABRAHAM 
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? 
SAMPSON 
I do bite my thumb, sir. 
ABRAHAM 
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? 
SAMPSON 
[Aside to PETER] Is the law of our side, if I say ay? 
PETER 
No. 

SAMPSON 
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my thumb, sir. 
PETER 
Do you quarrel, sir? 
ABRAHAM 
Quarrel sir! no, sir. 
SAMPSON 
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you. 
ABRAHAM 
No better. 
SAMPSON 
Well, sir. 
PETER 
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen. 
SAMPSON 
Yes, better, sir. 
ABRAHAM 
You lie. 
SAMPSON 
Draw, if you be men.  
(They fight) 
Enter BENVOLIO 
BENVOLIO 
Part, fools! 
Put up your swords; you know not what you do. 
(Beats down their swords) 
Enter TYBALT 
TYBALT 
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? 
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death. 
BENVOLIO 
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword, 
Or manage it to part these men with me. 
TYBALT 
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word, 
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: 
Have at thee, coward! 
(They fight) 

Enter CAPULET, and LADY CAPULET 
CAPULET 
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! 
LADY CAPULET 
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword? 
CAPULET 
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come, 
And flourishes his blade in spite of me. 
Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE 
LADY MONTAGUE 
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe. 
MONTAGUE 
Hold me not, let me go. 
Enter PRINCE, with Attendants 
PRINCE 
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, 
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground, 
And hear the sentence of your moved prince. 
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, 
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, 
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets, 
If ever you disturb our streets again, 
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. 
For this time, all the rest depart away: 
You Capulet; shall go along with me: 
And, Montague, come you this afternoon, 
To know our further pleasure in this case, 
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. 
Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO 
MONTAGUE 
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? 
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? 

BENVOLIO 
Here were the servants of your adversary, 
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach: 
I drew to part them: in the instant came 
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, 
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, 
Came more and more and fought on part and part, 
Till the prince came, who parted either part. 
LADY MONTAGUE 
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day? 
Right glad I am he was not at this fray. 
BENVOLIO 
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun 
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east, 
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; 
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore 
So early walking did I see your son: 
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me 
And stole into the covert of the wood. 
MONTAGUE 
Many a morning hath he there been seen, 
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew. 
Black and portentous must this humour prove, 
Unless good counsel may the cause remove. 
BENVOLIO 
My noble uncle, do you know the cause? 
MONTAGUE 
I neither know it nor can learn of him. 
BENVOLIO 
Have you importuned him by any means? 
MONTAGUE 
Both by myself and many other friends: 
But he, his own affections' counsellor, 
Enter ROMEO 
BENVOLIO 
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside; 
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied. 
MONTAGUE 
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay, 
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away. 
Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE 

BENVOLIO 
Good-morrow, cousin. 
ROMEO 
Is the day so young? 
BENVOLIO 
But new struck nine. 
ROMEO 
Ay me! sad hours seem long. 
Was that my father that went hence so fast? 
BENVOLIO 
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours? 
ROMEO 
Not having that, which, having, makes them short. 
BENVOLIO 
In love? 
ROMEO 
Out-- 
BENVOLIO 
Of love? 
ROMEO 
Out of her favour, where I am in love. 
BENVOLIO 
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, 
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! 
ROMEO 
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, 
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! 
O me! What fray was here? 
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. 
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. 
Farewell, my coz. 
BENVOLIO 
 Soft! I will go along; 
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love. 
ROMEO 
What, shall I groan and tell thee? 
BENVOLIO 
Groan! why, no. 
But sadly tell me who. 

ROMEO 
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. 
BENVOLIO 
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved. 
ROMEO 
A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love. 
BENVOLIO 
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. 
ROMEO 
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow 
Do I live dead that live to tell it now. 
BENVOLIO 
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her. 
ROMEO 
O, teach me how I should forget to think. 
BENVOLIO 
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; 
Examine other beauties. 
ROMEO 
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget. 
Exeunt

SCENE 2 
A Street 
Enter CAPULET AND PARIS 
CAPULET 
But Montague is bound as well as I, 
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think, 
For men so old as we to keep the peace. 
PARIS 
Of honourable reckoning are you both; 
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long. 
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? 
CAPULET 
But saying o'er what I have said before: 
My child is yet a stranger in the world; 

She hath not seen the change of fourteen years, 
Let two more summers wither in their pride, 
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. 
PARIS 
Younger than she are happy mothers made. 
CAPULET 
And too soon marr'd are those so early made. 
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she, 
She is the hopeful lady of my earth: 
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, 
My will to her consent is but a part. 
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast, 
Whereto I have invited many a guest, 
Such as I love; and you, among the store, 
One more, most welcome, makes my number more. 
Come, go with me. 
Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS 



13 

SCENE 2a 
A Street 
Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO 
BENVOLIO 
Take thou some new infection to thy eye, 
And the rank poison of the old will die. 
Enter PETER 
ROMEO 
God-den, good fellow. 
PETER 
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read? 
ROMEO 
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. 
(Reads) 
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; 
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady 
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely 
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine 
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece 
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin 
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair 
assembly: whither should they come? 

PETER 
To supper; to our house. 
ROMEO 
Whose house? 
PETER 
My master's. 
ROMEO 
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before. 
PETER 
Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the 
great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house 
of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine. 
Rest you merry! 
Exit Peter 
BENVOLIO 
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's 
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest, 
With all the admired beauties of Verona: 
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye, 
Compare her face with some that I shall show, 
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. 
ROMEO 
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun 
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. 
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown, 
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own. 
Exeunt

SCENE 3 
A room in Capulet's house. 
Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse  
LADY CAPULET 
Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me. 
NURSE 
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old, 
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird! 
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet! 
Enter JULIET 
JULIET 
How now! who calls? 
NURSE 
Your mother. 
JULIET 
Madam, I am here. 
What is your will? 
LADY CAPULET 
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile, 
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again; 
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. 
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age. 
NURSE 
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour. 
LADY CAPULET 
She's not fourteen. 
NURSE 
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,-- 
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four-- 
She is not fourteen. How long is it now 
To Lammas-tide? 
LADY CAPULET 
A fortnight and odd days. 

NURSE 
Even or odd, of all days in the year, 
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen. 
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!-- 
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God; 
She was too good for me: but, as I said, 
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; 
That shall she, marry; I remember it well. 
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; 
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,-- 
Of all the days of the year, upon that day: 
My lord and you were then at Mantua:-- 
Nay, I do bear a brain: 
For then she could stand alone; nay,  
She could have run and waddled all about; 
For even the day before, she broke her brow: 
And then my husband--God be with his soul! 
A' was a merry man--took up the child: 
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face? 
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; 
Wilt thou not, Jule?'  
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.' 
To see, now, how a jest shall come about! 
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years, 
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he; 
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.' 
LADY CAPULET 
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace. 
NURSE 
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace! 
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed: 
An I might live to see thee married once, 
I have my wish. 
LADY CAPULET 
Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme 
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, 
How stands your disposition to be married? 
JULIET 
It is an honour that I dream not of. 
NURSE 
An honour! were not I thine only nurse, 
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat. 

LADY CAPULET 
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you, 
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, 
Are made already mothers: by my count, 
I was your mother much upon these years 
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: 
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. 
NURSE 
A man, young lady! lady, such a man 
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax. 
LADY CAPULET 
Verona's summer hath not such a flower. 
NURSE 
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower. 
LADY CAPULET 
What say you? can you love the gentleman? 
This night you shall behold him at our feast; 
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, 
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; 
So shall you share all that he doth possess, 
By having him, making yourself no less. 
NURSE 
No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men. 
LADY CAPULET 
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love? 
JULIET 
I'll look to like, if looking liking move: 
But no more deep will I endart mine eye 
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. 
Enter PETER 
PETER 
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you 
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in 
the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must 
hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight. 
LADY CAPULET 
We follow thee. 
Juliet, the county stays. 
NURSE 
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. 
Exeunt

SCENE 4 
A street. 
Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO and others 
ROMEO 
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? 
Or shall we on without a apology? 
BENVOLIO 
But let them measure us by what they will; 
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone. 
ROMEO 
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling; 
Being but heavy, I will bear the light. 
MERCUTIO 
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. 
ROMEO 
Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes 
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead 
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. 
MERCUTIO 
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; 
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. 
Give me a case to put my visage in: 
A visor for a visor!  
BENVOLIO 
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in, 
But every man betake him to his legs. 
ROMEO 
And we mean well in going to this mask; 
But 'tis no wit to go. 
MERCUTIO 
Why, may one ask? 
ROMEO 
I dream'd a dream to-night. 
MERCUTIO 
And so did I. 
ROMEO 
Well, what was yours? 
MERCUTIO 
That dreamers often lie. 

ROMEO 
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. 
MERCUTIO 
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. 
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes 
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone 
On the fore-finger of an alderman, 
Drawn with a team of little atomies 
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep; 
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs, 
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, 
The traces of the smallest spider's web, 
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams, 
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film, 
And in this state she gallops night by night 
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; 
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream, 
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, 
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: 
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail 
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep, 
Then dreams, he of another benefice: 
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, 
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, 
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, 
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two 
And sleeps again.  
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, 
That presses them and learns them first to bear, 
Making them women of good carriage: 
This is she-- 
ROMEO 
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! 
Thou talk'st of nothing. 
MERCUTIO 
True, I talk of dreams, 
Which are the children of an idle brain, 
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, 
Which is as thin of substance as the air 
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes 
Even now the frozen bosom of the north, 
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, 
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south. 

BENVOLIO 
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; 
Supper is done, and we shall come too late. 
ROMEO 
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives 
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars 
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date 
With this night's revels and expire the term 
Of a despised life closed in my breast 
By some vile forfeit of untimely death. 
But He, that hath the steerage of my course, 
Direct my sail!  
Exeunt 



19

SCENE 5 
A hall in Capulet's house. 
Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meet-ing the Guests and Maskers 
CAPULET 
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes 
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you. 
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all 
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, 
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now? 
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day 
That I have worn a visor and could tell 
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear, 
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone: 
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play. 
(Music plays, and they dance) 
ROMEO 
What lady is that, which doth 
enrich the hand 
Of yonder knight? 
BENVOLIO 
I know not, sir. 

ROMEO 
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! 
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night 
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear; 
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! 
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows, 
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows. 
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! 
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night. 
TYBALT 
This, by his voice, should be a Montague. 
What dares the slave 
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face, 
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? 
CAPULET 
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so? 
TYBALT 
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, 
A villain that is hither come in spite, 
To scorn at our solemnity this night. 
CAPULET 
Young Romeo is it? 
TYBALT 
'Tis he, that villain Romeo. 
CAPULET 
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone; 
He bears him like a portly gentleman; 
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him 
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth: 
I would not for the wealth of all the town 
Here in my house do him disparagement: 
Therefore be patient, take no note of him: 
TYBALT 
I'll not endure him. 
CAPULET 
He shall be endured: 
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; 
Am I the master here, or you? go to. 
You'll not endure him! ! 
You'll make a mutiny among my guests! 

TYBALT 
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame. 
CAPULET 
Go to, go to; 
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed? 
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go: 
Be quiet, or-- I'll make you quiet.  
TYBALT 
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall 
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall. 
Exit Tybalt 
ROMEO 
[To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand 
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: 
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand 
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. 
JULIET 
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, 
Which mannerly devotion shows in this; 
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, 
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. 
ROMEO 
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? 
JULIET 
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. 
ROMEO 
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; 
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. 
JULIET 
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. 
ROMEO 
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. 
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged. 
JULIET 
Then have my lips the sin that they have took. 
ROMEO 
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged! 
Give me my sin again. 
JULIET 
You kiss by the book. 

NURSE 
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. 
ROMEO 
What is her mother? 
NURSE 
Marry, bachelor, 
Her mother is the lady of the house, 
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous 
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal; 
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her 
Shall have the chinks. 
ROMEO 
Is she a Capulet? 
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt. 
Exit party guests 
JULIET 
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman? 
NURSE 
I know not. 
JULIET 
Go ask his name: if he be married. 
My grave is like to be my wedding bed. 
NURSE 
His name is Romeo, and a Montague; 
The only son of your great enemy. 
JULIET 
My only love sprung from my only hate! 
Too early seen unknown, and known too late! 
Prodigious birth of love it is to me, 
That I must love a loathed enemy. 
Exeunt

ACT II

SCENE 1 
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard. 
Enter ROMEO hiding 
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO 
BENVOLIO 
Romeo! my cousin Romeo! 
MERCUTIO 
He is wise; 
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed. 
BENVOLIO 
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall: 
Call, good Mercutio. 
MERCUTIO 
Nay, I'll conjure too. 
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! 
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh: 
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not; 
The ape is dead. 
BENVOLIO 
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees, 
To be consorted with the humorous night: 
Blind is his love and best befits the dark. 
MERCUTIO 
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. 
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; 
Come, shall we go? 
BENVOLIO 
Go, then; for 'tis in vain 
To seek him here that means not to be found. 
Exeunt 


26 

SCENE 2 
Capulet's orchard. 
Enter ROMEO  
ROMEO 
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. 
JULIET appears above at a window 
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? 
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. 
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, 
Who is already sick and pale with grief. 
It is my lady, O, it is my love! 
O, that she knew she were! 
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that? 
Her eye discourses; I will answer it. 
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks: 
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, 
Having some business, do entreat her eyes 
To twinkle in their spheres till they return. 
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand! 
O, that I were a glove upon that hand, 
That I might touch that cheek! 
JULIET 
Ay me! 
ROMEO 
She speaks: 
O, speak again, bright angel!  
JULIET 
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I'll no longer be a Capulet. 
ROMEO 
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? 
JULIET 
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; 
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. 
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, 
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part 
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! 
What's in a name? that which we call a rose 

By any other name would smell as sweet; 
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, 
Retain that dear perfection which he owes 
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, 
And for that name which is no part of thee 
Take all myself. 
ROMEO 
I take thee at thy word: 
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized; 
Henceforth I never will be Romeo. 
JULIET 
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night 
So stumblest on my counsel? 
ROMEO 
By a name 
I know not how to tell thee who I am: 
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, 
Because it is an enemy to thee; 
Had I it written, I would tear the word. 
JULIET 
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words 
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound: 
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague? 
ROMEO 
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. 
JULIET 
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? 
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, 
And the place death, considering who thou art, 
If any of my kinsmen find thee here. 
ROMEO 
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; 
For stony limits cannot hold love out, 
And what love can do that dares love attempt; 
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. 
JULIET 
If they do see thee, they will murder thee. 
ROMEO 
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight; 
And but thou love me, let them find me here: 
My life were better ended by their hate, 
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. 

JULIET 
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' 
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, 
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries 
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, 
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully: 
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, 
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay, 
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. 
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, 
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light: 
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true 
Than those that have more cunning to be strange. 
I should have been more strange, I must confess, 
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware, 
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me, 
And not impute this yielding to light love, 
Which the dark night hath so discovered. 
ROMEO 
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear 
JULIET 
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, 
That monthly changes in her circled orb, 
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. 
ROMEO 
What shall I swear by? 
JULIET 
Do not swear at all; 
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, 
Which is the god of my idolatry, 
And I'll believe thee. 
ROMEO 
If my heart's dear love-- 
JULIET 
Sweet, good night! 
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, 
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. 
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest 
Come to thy heart as that within my breast! 
ROMEO 
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? 

JULIET 
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night? 
ROMEO 
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. 
JULIET 
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it: 
And yet I would it were to give again. 
ROMEO 
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love? 
JULIET 
But to be frank, and give it thee again. 
And yet I wish but for the thing I have: 
My bounty is as boundless as the sea, 
My love as deep; the more I give to thee, 
The more I have, for both are infinite. 
(NURSE calls within) 
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu! 
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. 
Stay but a little, I will come again. 
Exit, above 
ROMEO 
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard. 
Being in night, all this is but a dream, 
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. 
Re-enter JULIET, above 
JULIET 
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. 
If that thy bent of love be honourable, 
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, 
By one that I'll procure to come to thee, 
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; 
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay 
And follow thee my lord throughout the world. 
NURSE 
[Within] Madam! 
JULIET 
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well, 
I do beseech thee-- 
NURSE 
[Within] Madam! 

JULIET 
By and by, I come:-- 
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief: 
To-morrow will I send. 
ROMEO 
So thrive my soul-- 
JULIET 
A thousand times good night! 
Exit, above 
ROMEO 
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. 
Re-enter JULIET, above 
JULIET 
Romeo! 
ROMEO 
My love? 
JULIET 
At what o'clock to-morrow 
Shall I send to thee? 
ROMEO 
At the hour of nine. 
JULIET 
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then. 
I have forgot why I did call thee back. 
ROMEO 
Let me stand here till thou remember it. 
JULIET 
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, 
Remembering how I love thy company. 
ROMEO 
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, 
Forgetting any other home but this. 
JULIET 
Good night, good night! parting is such 
sweet sorrow, 
That I shall say good night till it be morrow. 
Exit above 

ROMEO 
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! 
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! 
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell, 
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

SCENE 3 
Friar Laurence's cell. 
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket  
FRIAR LAURENCE 
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, 
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, 
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels 
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels: 
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, 
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, 
Enter ROMEO 
ROMEO 
Good morrow, father. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? 
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head 
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed: 
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure 
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature; 
Or if not so, then here I hit it right, 
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night. 
ROMEO 
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline? 
ROMEO 
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no; 
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then? 

ROMEO 
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again. 
I have been feasting with mine enemy, 
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; 
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. 
ROMEO 
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set 
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet: 
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; 
And all combined, save what thou must combine 
By holy marriage: when and where and how 
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow, 
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, 
That thou consent to marry us to-day. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! 
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, 
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies 
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. 
What a deal of brine 
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! 
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then, 
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men. 
ROMEO 
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. 
ROMEO 
And bad'st me bury love. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Not in a grave, 
To lay one in, another out to have. 
ROMEO 
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now 
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
But come, young waverer, come, go with me, 
In one respect I'll thy assistant be; 
For this alliance may so happy prove, 
To turn your households' rancour to pure love. 

ROMEO 
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. 
Exeunt

SCENE 4 
A street. 
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO 
MERCUTIO 
Where the devil should this Romeo be? 
Came he not home to-night? 
BENVOLIO 
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man. 
MERCUTIO 
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. 
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad. 
BENVOLIO 
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, 
Hath sent a letter to his father's house. 
MERCUTIO 
A challenge, on my life. 
BENVOLIO 
Romeo will answer it. 
MERCUTIO 
Any man that can write may answer a letter. 
BENVOLIO 
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he 
dares, being dared. 
MERCUTIO 
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a 
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a 
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the 
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to 
encounter Tybalt? 
BENVOLIO 
Why, what is Tybalt? 

MERCUTIO 
More than prince of cats, I can tell you.  
Enter ROMEO 
BENVOLIO 
Here comes Romeo. 
MERCUTIO 
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation 
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit 
fairly last night. 
ROMEO 
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you? 
MERCUTIO 
The slip, sir, the slip; can you not conceive? 
ROMEO 
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in 
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy. 
MERCUTIO 
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint. 
ROMEO 
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match. 
MERCUTIO 
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? 
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art 
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: 
for this drivelling love is like a great natural, 
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole. 
BENVOLIO 
Stop there, stop there. 
MERCUTIO 
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair. 
BENVOLIO 
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. 
MERCUTIO 
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short: 
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and 
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer. 
ROMEO 
Here's goodly gear! 
Enter Nurse and PETER 

MERCUTIO 
A sail, a sail! 
BENVOLIO 
Two, two; a shirt and a smock. 
NURSE 
Peter! 
PETER 
Anon! 
NURSE 
My fan, Peter. 
MERCUTIO 
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the 
fairer face. 
NURSE 
God ye good morrow, gentlemen. 
MERCUTIO 
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman. 
NURSE 
Is it good den? 
MERCUTIO 
'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the 
dial is now upon the prick of noon. 
NURSE 
Out upon you! what a man are you! 
ROMEO 
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar. 
NURSE 
By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,' 
quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I 
may find the young Romeo? 
ROMEO 
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse. 
NURSE 
if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you. 
BENVOLIO 
She will indite him to some supper. 
MERCUTIO 
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho! 

ROMEO 
I will follow you. 
MERCUTIO 
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, 
Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO 
NURSE 
Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy 
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery? 
ROMEO 
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, 
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand 
to in a month. 
NURSE 
An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him 
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such 
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall. 
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am 
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by 
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure? 
Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word: 
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you 
out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself: 
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into 
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross 
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman 
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double 
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered 
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. 
ROMEO 
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.  
Bid her devise 
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon; 
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell 
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains. 
NURSE 
No truly sir; not a penny. 
ROMEO 
Go to; I say you shall. 
NURSE 
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there. 

ROMEO 
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress. 
NURSE 
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord, 
Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there 
is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain 
lay knife aboard.  
ROMEO 
Commend me to thy lady. 
NURSE 
Ay, a thousand times. 
Exit Romeo 
Peter! 
PETER 
Anon! 
NURSE 
Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace. 
Exeunt

SCENE 5 
Capulet’s orchard 
Enter JULIET  
JULIET 
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse; 
In half an hour she promised to return. 
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so. 
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts, 
Had she affections and warm youthful blood, 
She would be as swift in motion as a ball; 
But old folks, many feign as they were dead; 
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. 
O God, she comes! 
Enter Nurse and PETER 
O honey nurse, what news? 
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. 
NURSE 
Peter, stay at the gate. 
Exit PETER 

JULIET 
Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad? 
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; 
NURSE 
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: 
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had! 
JULIET 
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: 
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak. 
NURSE 
Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile? 
Do you not see that I am out of breath? 
JULIET 
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath 
To say to me that thou art out of breath? 
What says he of our marriage? what of that? 
NURSE 
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! 
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. 
Beshrew your heart for sending me about, 
To catch my death with jaunting up and down! 
JULIET 
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? 
NURSE 
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a 
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I 
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother? 
JULIET 
Where is my mother! why, she is within; 
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest! 
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman, 
Where is your mother?' 
NURSE 
O God's lady dear! 
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow; 
Is this the poultice for my aching bones? 
Henceforward do your messages yourself. 
JULIET 
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo? 
NURSE 
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day? 

JULIET 
I have. 
NURSE 
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell; 
There stays a husband to make you a wife: 
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks, 
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news. 
Hie you to church.     
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell. 
JULIET 
Honest nurse, farewell. 
Exeunt

SCENE 6 
Friar Laurence's cell. 
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO  
FRIAR LAURENCE 
So smile the heavens upon this holy act, 
That after hours with sorrow chide us not! 
ROMEO 
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can, 
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy 
That one short minute gives me in her sight: 
Do thou but close our hands with holy words, 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
These violent delights have violent ends 
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, 
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey 
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness 
And in the taste confounds the appetite: 
Therefore love moderately. 
Enter JULIET 
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot 
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint: 
JULIET 
Good even to my ghostly confessor. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. 

JULIET 
As much to him, else is his thanks too much. 
ROMEO 
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy 
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more 
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath 
This neighbour air. 
JULIET 
They are but beggars that can count their worth; 
But my true love is grown to such excess 
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Come, come with me, and we will make short work; 
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone 
Till holy church incorporate two in one. 
Exeunt

ACT III 


43 

SCENE 1 
A public place. 
Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, and others 
BENVOLIO 
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire: 
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad, 
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl; 
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. 
MERCUTIO 
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he 
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword 
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of 
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws 
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. 
BENVOLIO 
Am I like such a fellow? 
MERCUTIO 
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none 
shortly, for one would kill the other.  
thou hast quarrelled with a 
man for coughing in the street, because he hath 
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun: 
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing 
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for 
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou 
wilt tutor me from quarrelling! 
BENVOLIO 
By my head, here come the Capulets. 
MERCUTIO 
By my heel, I care not. 
Enter TYBALT and others 
TYBALT 
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you. 
MERCUTIO 
And but one word with one of us? couple it with 
something; make it a word and a blow. 
TYBALT 
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you 
will give me occasion. 

MERCUTIO 
Could you not take some occasion without giving? 
TYBALT 
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,-- 
MERCUTIO 
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an 
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but 
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall 
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort! 
BENVOLIO 
We talk here in the public haunt of men: 
Either withdraw unto some private place, 
And reason coldly of your grievances, 
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us. 
MERCUTIO 
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze; 
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I. 
Enter ROMEO 
TYBALT 
Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man. 
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford 
No better term than this,--thou art a villain. 
ROMEO 
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee 
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage 
To such a greeting: villain am I none; 
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not. 
TYBALT 
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries 
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw. 
ROMEO 
I do protest, I never injured thee, 
But love thee better than thou canst devise, 
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender 
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied. 
MERCUTIO 
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission! 
(Draws) 
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk? 

TYBALT 
What wouldst thou have with me? 
MERCUTIO 
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine 
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you 
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the 
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher 
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your 
ears ere it be out. 
TYBALT 
I am for you. 
(Drawing) 
ROMEO 
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up. 
(They fight) 
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons. 
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage! 
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath 
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets: 
(TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers) 
MERCUTIO 
I am hurt. 
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped. 
Is he gone, and hath nothing? 
BENVOLIO 
What, art thou hurt? 
MERCUTIO 
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough. 
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon. 
Exit PAGE 
ROMEO 
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much. 

MERCUTIO 
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a 
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for 
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. 
A plague o' both your houses!  
'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a 
cat, to scratch a man to death!  
Why the devil came you between us? I 
was hurt under your arm. 
ROMEO 
I thought all for the best. 
MERCUTIO 
Help me into some house, Benvolio, 
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses! 
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it, 
And soundly too: your houses! 
BENVOLIO 
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead! 
ROMEO 
This day's black fate on more days doth depend; 
This but begins the woe, others must end. 
BENVOLIO 
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. 
ROMEO 
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain! 
Re-enter TYBALT 
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again, 
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul 
Is but a little way above our heads, 
Staying for thine to keep him company: 
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him. 
TYBALT 
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, 
Shalt with him hence. 
ROMEO 
This shall determine that. 
(They fight; TYBALT falls) 

BENVOLIO 
Romeo, away, be gone! 
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. 
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death, 
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away! 
ROMEO 
O, I am fortune's fool! 
Exit ROMEO 
Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others 
PRINCE 
Where are the vile beginners of this fray? 
BENVOLIO 
O noble prince, I can discover all 
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl: 
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, 
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. 
LADY CAPULET 
Prince, as thou art true, 
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague. 
PRINCE 
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? 
BENVOLIO 
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay; 
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink 
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal 
Your high displeasure: all this uttered 
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd, 
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen 
Of Tybalt deaf to peace,  
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life 
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; 
But by and by comes back to Romeo, 
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, 
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I 
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain. 
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. 
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. 

LADY CAPULET 
He is a kinsman to the Montague; 
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true: 
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give; 
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live. 
PRINCE 
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio; 
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? 
MONTAGUE 
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend; 
His fault concludes but what the law should end, 
The life of Tybalt. 
PRINCE 
And for that offence 
Immediately we do exile him hence: 
let Romeo hence in haste, 
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last. 
Bear hence this body and attend our will: 
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. 
Exeunt

SCENE 2 
Capulet's orchard. 
Enter JULIET 
JULIET 
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, 
Towards Phoebus' lodging. 
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die, 
Take him and cut him out in little stars, 
And he will make the face of heaven so fine 
That all the world will be in love with night 
O, here comes my nurse, 
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks 
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence. 
Enter Nurse 
Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands? 
NURSE 
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead! 
We are undone, lady, we are undone! 
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead! 

JULIET 
Can heaven be so envious? 
NURSE 
Romeo can, 
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo! 
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo! 
JULIET 
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus? 
Hath Romeo slain himself?  
NURSE 
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,-- 
here on his manly breast: 
A piteous corse,  
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood, 
I swounded at the sight. 
JULIET 
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once! 
NURSE 
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had! 
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman! 
That ever I should live to see thee dead! 
JULIET 
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead? 
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord? 
NURSE 
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished; 
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished. 
JULIET 
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? 
NURSE 
It did, it did; alas the day, it did! 
JULIET 
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face! 
Was ever book containing such vile matter 
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell 
In such a gorgeous palace! 
NURSE 
There's no trust, 
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured, 
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. 

JULIET 
Blister'd be thy tongue 
For such a wish! he was not born to shame: 
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit. 
NURSE 
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin? 
JULIET 
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband? 
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, 
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it? 
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? 
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband: 
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain; 
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband: 
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then? 
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse? 
NURSE 
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse: 
JULIET 
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent, 
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment. 
NURSE 
Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo 
To comfort you: I wot well where he is. 
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night: 
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell. 
JULIET 
O, find him!  
And bid him come to take his last farewell. 
Exeunt

SCENE 3 
Friar Laurence's cell. 
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE & ROMEO 
ROMEO 
Father, what news?  
FRIAR LAURENCE 
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom. 
ROMEO 
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom? 

FRIAR LAURENCE 
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips, 
Not body's death, but body's banishment. 
ROMEO 
Banishment! be merciful, say 'death;' 
do not say 'banishment.' 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Hence from Verona art thou banished: 
ROMEO 
There is no world without Verona walls, 
But purgatory, torture, hell itself. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. 
ROMEO 
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here, 
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog 
And little mouse, every unworthy thing, 
Live here in heaven and may look on her; 
But Romeo may not; he is banished: 
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death? 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word. 
ROMEO 
Thou wilt speak again of banishment. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
O, then I see that madmen have no ears. 
ROMEO 
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes? 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate. 
ROMEO 
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel: 
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, 
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered, 
Doting like me and like me banished, 
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, 
And fall upon the ground, as I do now, 
Taking the measure of an unmade grave. 
(Knocking within) 

FRIAR LAURENCE 
Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself. 
ROMEO 
Not I; 
(Knocking) 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise; 
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up; 
(Knocking) 
Run to my study. By and by! God's will, 
What simpleness is this! I come, I come! 
(Knocking) 
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will? 
NURSE 
[Within] Let me come in, and you shall know 
my errand; 
I come from Lady Juliet. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Welcome, then. 
Enter Nurse 
NURSE 
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar, 
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo? 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. 
NURSE 
O, he is even in my mistress' case, 
Just in her case! O woeful sympathy! 
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she, 
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering. 
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man: 
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand; 
Why should you fall into so deep an O? 
ROMEO 
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her? 
Doth she not think me an old murderer, 
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says 
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love? 

NURSE 
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps; 
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up, 
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries. 
ROMEO 
As if that name, 
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand 
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me, 
In what vile part of this anatomy 
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack 
The hateful mansion. 
(Drawing his sword) 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Hold thy desperate hand: 
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art: 
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote 
The unreasonable fury of a beast. 
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself? 
Thy Juliet is alive, 
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee, 
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too: 
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend 
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy: 
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back; 
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed, 
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her: 
But look thou stay not till the watch be set, 
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua; 
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time 
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, 
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back 
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy 
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation. 
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady; 
And bid her hasten all the house to bed, 
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto: 
Romeo is coming. 
NURSE 
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night 
To hear good counsel. 
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come. 
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. 
Exit 

ROMEO 
How well my comfort is revived by this! 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state: 
Either be gone before the watch be set, 
Or by the break of day disguised from hence. 
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night. 
ROMEO 
But that a joy past joy calls out on me, 
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell. 
Exeunt

SCENE 4 
A room in Capulet's house. 
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS 
CAPULET 
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, 
That we have had no time to move our daughter: 
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly, 
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die. 
PARIS 
These times of woe afford no time to woo. 
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter. 
LADY CAPULET 
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow; 
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness. 
CAPULET 
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender 
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled 
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not. 
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed; 
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love; 
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next-- 
But, soft! what day is this? 
PARIS 
Monday, my lord, 
CAPULET 
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon, 
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her, 
She shall be married to this noble earl. 
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday? 

PARIS 
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow. 
CAPULET 
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then. 
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed, 
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day. 
Farewell, my lord. 
it is so very very late, 
That we may call it early by and by. 
Exeunt 



55 

SCENE 5 
Capulet's orchard. 
Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window 
JULIET 
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day: 
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, 
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear; 
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree: 
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. 
ROMEO 
It was the lark, the herald of the morn, 
No nightingale.  
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day 
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. 
I must be gone and live, or stay and die. 
JULIET 
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I: 
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone. 
ROMEO 
Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death; 
I am content, so thou wilt have it so. 
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, 
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat 
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads: 
I have more care to stay than will to go: 
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so. 
JULIET 
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away! 
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, 

Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. 
Some say the lark makes sweet division; 
This doth not so, for she divideth us: 
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows. 
ROMEO 
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes! 
(Knocking) 
NURSE 
[Within] Madam! 
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber: 
The day is broke; be wary, look about. 
JULIET 
Then, window, let day in, and let life out. 
ROMEO 
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend. 
JULIET 
Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend! 
I must hear from thee every day in the hour, 
For in a minute there are many days: 
O, by this count I shall be much in years 
Ere I again behold my Romeo! 
ROMEO 
Farewell! 
I will omit no opportunity 
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee. 
JULIET 
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again? 
ROMEO 
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve 
For sweet discourses in our time to come. 
Exit ROMEO 
LADY CAPULET 
[Within] Ho, daughter! are you up? 
JULIET 
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother? 
Is she not down so late, or up so early? 
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither? 
Enter LADY CAPULET 

LADY CAPULET 
Why, how now, Juliet! 
JULIET 
Madam, I am not well. 
LADY CAPULET 
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death? 
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? 
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live; 
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love. 
Thou weep'st not so much for his death, 
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him. 
JULIET 
What villain madam? 
LADY CAPULET 
That same villain, Romeo. 
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not: 
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua, 
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live, 
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram, 
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company. 
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. 
JULIET 
And joy comes well in such a needy time: 
LADY CAPULET 
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; 
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, 
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy, 
JULIET 
Madam, in happy time, what day is that? 
LADY CAPULET 
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, 
The gallant, young and noble gentleman, 
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, 
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. 
JULIET 
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too, 
He shall not make me there a joyful bride. 
LADY CAPULET 
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself, 
And see how he will take it at your hands. 
Enter CAPULET and NURSE 

CAPULET 
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears? 
Evermore showering?  
How now, wife! 
Have you deliver'd to her our decree? 
LADY CAPULET 
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. 
I would the fool were married to her grave! 
CAPULET 
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife. 
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks? 
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest, 
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought 
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? 
JULIET 
Good father, I beseech you on my knees, 
Hear me with patience but to speak a word. 
CAPULET 
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch! 
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday, 
Or never after look me in the face: 
 NURSE   
God in heaven bless her! 
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. 
CAPULET 
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue, 
NURSE 
I speak no treason. 
CAPULET 
O, God ye god-den. 
NURSE 
May not one speak? 
CAPULET 
Peace, you mumbling fool! 
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl; 
For here we need it not. 
LADY CAPULET 
You are too hot. 

CAPULET 
God's bread! it makes me mad! 
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart,  
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend; 
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, 
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, 
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good: 
Exit 
JULIET 
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away! 
Delay this marriage for a month, a week; 
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed 
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. 
LADY CAPULET 
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word: 
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. 
Exit 
JULIET 
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented? 
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy? 
Some comfort, nurse. 
NURSE 
Faith, here it is. 
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing, 
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you; 
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth. 
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, 
I think it best you married with the county. 
O, he's a lovely gentleman! 
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam, 
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye 
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, 
I think you are happy in this second match, 
For it excels your first: or if it did not, 
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were, 
As living here and you no use of him. 
JULIET 
Speakest thou from thy heart? 
NURSE 
And from my soul too; 
Or else beshrew them both. 

JULIET 
Amen! 
NURSE 
What? 
JULIET 
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. 
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone, 
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell, 
To make confession and to be absolved. 
NURSE 
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. 
Exit 
JULIET 
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy: 
If all else fail, myself have power to die.

ACT IV

SCENE 1 
Friar Laurence's cell. 
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short. 
You say you do not know the lady's mind: 
Uneven is the course, I like it not. 
PARIS 
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death, 
And therefore have I little talk'd of love; 
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell. 
Enter JULIET 
PARIS 
Happily met, my lady and my wife! 
JULIET 
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. 
PARIS 
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next. 
JULIET 
What must be shall be. 
PARIS 
Come you to make confession to this father? 
JULIET 
To answer that, I should confess to you. 
PARIS 
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears. 
JULIET 
Are you at leisure, holy father, now; 
Or shall I come to you at evening mass? 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now. 
My lord, we must entreat the time alone. 
PARIS 
God shield I should disturb devotion! 
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye: 
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. 
Exit 

JULIET 
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so, 
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help! 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief; 
It strains me past the compass of my wits: 
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, 
On Thursday next be married to this county. 
JULIET 
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, 
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it: 
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands; 
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd, 
Shall be the label to another deed. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope, 
Which craves as desperate an execution. 
As that is desperate which we would prevent. 
If, rather than to marry County Paris, 
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, 
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake 
A thing like death to chide away this shame, 
That copest with death himself to scape from it: 
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy. 
JULIET 
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, 
From off the battlements of yonder tower; 
Or bid me go into a new-made grave 
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent 
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow: 
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone; 
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber: 
Take thou this vial, being then in bed, 
And this distilled liquor drink thou off; 
When presently through all thy veins shall run 
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse 
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease: 
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest; 
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death 
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, 

And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. 
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes 
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead: 
Then, as the manner of our country is, 
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier 
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault 
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. 
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, 
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, 
And hither shall he come: and he and I 
Will watch thy waking, and that very night 
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. 
JULIET 
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear! 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous 
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed 
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. 
JULIET 
Love give me strength!  
Farewell, dear father! 
Exeunt

Hall in Capulet's house. 
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, NURSE  
CAPULET 
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence? 
NURSE 
Ay, forsooth. 
CAPULET 
Well, he may chance to do some good on her: 
NURSE 
See where she comes from shrift with merry look. 
Enter JULIET 
CAPULET 
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gad-ding? 

JULIET 
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin 
Of disobedient opposition 
And beg your pardon; 
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you. 
CAPULET 
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up: 
This is as't should be.  
JULIET 
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet, 
To help me sort such needful ornaments 
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow? 
LADY CAPULET 
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough. 
CAPULET 
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow. 
Exeunt 



66 

SCENE 3 
Juliet's chamber. 
Enter JULIET and Nurse 
JULIET 
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse, 
I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night, 
Enter LADY CAPULET 
LADY CAPULET 
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help? 
JULIET 
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries 
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow: 
So please you, let me now be left alone, 
And let the nurse this night sit up with you; 
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all, 
In this so sudden business. 
LADY CAPULET 
Good night: 
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need. 
Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse 

JULIET 
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again. 
Come, vial. 
What if this mixture do not work at all? 
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning? 
No, no: this shall forbid it. 
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee. 
(She falls upon her bed)

SCENE 5 
Juliet's chamber. 
Enter NURSE 
NURSE 
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she: 
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed! 
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride! 
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep! 
I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam! 
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again! 
I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady! 
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead! 
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born! 
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady! 
Enter LADY CAPULET 
LADY CAPULET 
What noise is here? 
NURSE 
O lamentable day! 
LADY CAPULET 
What is the matter? 
NURSE 
Look, look! O heavy day! 
LADY CAPULET 
O me, O me! My child, my only life, 
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee! 
Help, help! Call help. 
Enter CAPULET 
CAPULET 
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come. 

NURSE 
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day! 
CAPULET 
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold: 
Death lies on her like an untimely frost 
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. 
NURSE 
O lamentable day! 
LADY CAPULET 
O woful time! 
CAPULET 
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail, 
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak. 
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Come, is the bride ready to go to church? 
CAPULET 
Ready to go, but never to return. 
O son! the night before thy wedding-day 
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies, 
Flower as she was, deflowered by him. 
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir; 
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die, 
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's. 
PARIS 
Have I thought long to see this morning's face, 
And doth it give me such a sight as this? 
LADY CAPULET 
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day! 
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw 
CAPULET 
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now 
To murder our solemnity? 
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead; 
And with my child my joys are buried. 
All things that we ordained festival, 
Turn from their office to black funeral. 
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, 
And all things change them to the contrary. 

FRIAR LAURENCE 
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; 
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare 
To follow this fair corse unto her grave: 
Exeunt

SCENE 1 
Mantua. A street. 
Enter ROMEO 
ROMEO 
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, 
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand: 
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead-- 
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips, 
That I revived. 
 Enter BALTHASAR 
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar! 
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar? 
How doth my lady?  
How fares my Juliet?  
For nothing can be ill, if she be well. 
BALTHASAR 
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill: 
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument, 
ROMEO 
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars! 
BALTHASAR 
I do beseech you, sir, have patience: 
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import 
Some misadventure. 
ROMEO 
Tush, thou art deceived. 
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar? 
BALTHASAR 
No, my good lord. 
ROMEO 
No matter: get thee gone, 
I'll be with thee straight. 
Exit BALTHASAR 
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night. 
Exeunt

SCENE 3 
A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets. 
Enter PARIS, and PAGE  
PARIS 
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along, 
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground; 
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, 
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me, 
As signal that thou hear'st something approach. 
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go. 
PAGE Retires 
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,-- 
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;-- 
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew, 
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans: 
The obsequies that I for thee will keep 
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep. 
(The Page whistles) 
The boy gives warning something doth approach. 
PARIS Retires 
Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR 
ROMEO 
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning 
See thou deliver it to my lord and father. 
Upon thy life, I charge thee, 
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof, 
And do not interrupt me in my course. 
BALTHASAR 
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. 
ROMEO 
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that: 
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow. 
BALTHASAR Retires 
ROMEO 
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, 
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth, 
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, 
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food! 

PARIS 
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague! 
Can vengeance be pursued further than death? 
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee: 
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die. 
ROMEO 
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. 
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man; 
Put not another sin upon my head, 
By urging me to fury: O, be gone! 
PARIS 
I do defy thy conjurations, 
And apprehend thee for a felon here. 
ROMEO 
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy! 
(They fight) 
PAGE EXIT 
PARIS 
O, I am slain! 
(Falls) 
If thou be merciful, 
Lay me with Juliet. 
(Dies) 
ROMEO 
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face. 
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris! 
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd. 
O my love! my wife! 
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath, 
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: 
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet 
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, 
And death's pale flag is not advanced there. 
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? 
O, what more favour can I do to thee, 
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain 
To sunder his that was thine enemy? 
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet, 
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe 
That unsubstantial death is amorous, 

And that the lean abhorred monster keeps 
Thee here in dark to be his paramour? 
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee; 
And never from this palace of dim night 
Depart again: here, here will I remain 
With worms that are thy chamber-maids. 
Eyes, look your last! 
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you 
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss 
A dateless bargain to engrossing death! 
Here's to my love! 
(Drinks) 
O true apothecary! 
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. 
(Dies) 
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Who's there? 
BALTHASAR 
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Who is it? 
BALTHASAR 
Balthasar 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
How long hath he been there? 
BALTHASAR 
Full half an hour. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Go with me to the vault. 
BALTHASAR 
I dare not, sir 
My master knows not but I am gone hence; 
And fearfully did menace me with death, 
If I did stay to look on his intents. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me: 
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing. 
(Enters the tomb) 

Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too? 
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour 
Is guilty of this lamentable chance! 
JULIET wakes 
JULIET 
O comfortable friar! where is my lord? 
I do remember well where I should be, 
And there I am. Where is my Romeo? 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Lady, come from that nest 
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep: 
A greater power than we can contradict 
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. 
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; 
Come, go, good Juliet, 
I dare no longer stay. 
JULIET 
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. 
Exit FRIAR LAURENCE 
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand? 
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end: 
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop 
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips; 
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, 
To make die with a restorative. 
(Kisses him) 
Thy lips are warm. 
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger! 
This is thy sheath; 
there rust, and let me die. 
(Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies) 
Enter The Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE,  the PRINCE, CAPULET, LADY CAPULET 
PRINCE 
What misadventure is so early up, 
That calls our person from our morning's rest? 
 CAPULET 
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad? 

LADY CAPULET 
The people in the street cry Romeo, 
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run, 
With open outcry toward our monument. 
PRINCE 
What fear is this which startles in our ears? 
WATCHMAN 
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain; 
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, 
Warm and new kill'd. 
Enter MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and FRIAR LAUR-ENCE 
PRINCE 
Come, Montague; for thou art early up, 
To see thy son and heir more early down. 
Good Father, say at once what thou dost know in this. 
FRIAR LAURENCE 
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; 
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife: 
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day 
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death 
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city, 
Then comes she to me, 
Gave I her, so tutor'd by my art, 
A sleeping potion; which so took effect 
As I intended, for it wrought on her 
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo, 
But he which bore my letter, 
Was stay'd by accident.  
All this I know; and to the marriage 
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this 
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life 
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time, 
Unto the rigour of severest law. 
PRINCE 
We still have known thee for a holy man. 
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this? 
BALTHASAR 
I brought my master news of Juliet's death; 
And then in post he came from Mantua 
To this same place, to this same monument. 

PRINCE 
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague! 
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate, 
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love. 
And I for winking at your discords too 
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd. 
 
 
 
EPILOGUE 
A glooming peace this morning with it brings; 
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head: 
For never was a story of more woe 
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. 
Exeunt
