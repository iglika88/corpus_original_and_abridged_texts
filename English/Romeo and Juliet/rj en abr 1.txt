

PROLOGUE 
CHORUS Two households both alike in dignity, In fair Verona where we lay our scene From ancient grudge, break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean: From forth the fatal loins of these two foes, A pair of star crossed lovers take their life: Whose misadventured piteous overthrows, 
Doth  with  their  death  burytheir  parents’  strife. 

SCENE 1 A street 
ENTER SAMPSON and GREGORY of the house of Capulet, in conversation. 
GREGORY Here come two of the house of Montague. 
ENTER two other servingmen, ABRAHAM and BALTHAZAR 
SAMPSON I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it. [He bites his thumb1] 
ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? SAMPSON I do bite my thumb, sir. ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? SAMPSON [to GREGORY] Is the law of our side if I say ay? GREGORY No. SAMPSON No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my 
thumb, sir. ABRAHAM You lie. SAMPSON Draw if you be men. 
They FIGHT. ENTER BENVOLIO2 
BENVOLIO Part, fools. Put up your swords, you know not what you do. 
1 Aninsult  the  equivalent  of or worse  than ‘the  middle  finger’. Done  in clear viewofthe  Montagues. 2 A name  meaning ‘goodwill’ the  opposite  of Malvolio, from Twelfth Night. 
ENTER TYBALT 
TYBALT  [To BENVOLIO] What, art thou drawn amongst these hartless hinds?3 Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.  
BENVOLIO  I do but keep the peace.  
TYBALT  What, drawn,4 and talk of peace? I hate the word  
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.  
They FIGHT  
ENTER three or four CITIZENS who attempt to BREAKUP the men  
ENTER old CAPULET, and LADY CAPULET  
CAPULET  What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!  
Old Montague is come!  
ENTER old MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE  
opposite  
MONTAGUE  [Spying CAPULET] Thou villain Capulet:[to LADY MONTAGUE who holds him back]Hold me not, let me go.  
LADY MONTAGUE  Thou shall not stir one foot to seek a foe.  
The couples remain either side of the stage, the womenholding their husbands back either by force, argument or childish with-holding of weapons. The SERVANTS, BENVOLIO and TYBALT remain in combat with the  
CITIZENS, centre stage  
ENTER PRINCE ESCALUS  
PRINCE  What ho, you men, you beasts  
Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground.  
The stage falls still  
Three civil brawls bred of an airy word,5  
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,  
Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets.  
If ever you disturb our streets again,  
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.  

3 Benvolio is interfering in a brawl between mere servants, Tybalt wishes to point this out. 4 Benvolio has drawn his weapon and yet he talks about peace. 5 A small and petty remark 
On pain of death, all men depart. 
EXIT all but BENVOLIO. ENTER ROMEO 
BENVOLIO Good morrow, cousin. ROMEO Is the day so young? 
Ay me, sad hours seem long. BENVOLIO What  sadness  lengthens  Romeo’s  hours? ROMEO Not having that which, having, makes them short.6 BENVOLIO In love? ROMEO Out. BENVOLIO Of love? ROMEO Out of her favour where I am in love. BENVOLIO Alas. ROMEO [seeing the destruction of the fight] 
Ay me what fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. BEVOLIO Tell me, in sadness, who is that you love? ROMEO In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. BENVOLIO I aimed so near when I supposed you loved. ROMEO A  right  good  markman! And  she’s  fair7 I love. BENVOLIO A right fair mark, fair coz8, is soonest hit. ROMEO. Well  in  that  hit  you  miss;;  she’ll  not  be  hit With  Cupid’s  arrow… 
BENVOLIO [giving it up] Then be ruled by me, forget to think of her. ROMEO O, teach me how I should forget to think. BENVOLIO By giving liberty unto thine eyes: 
Examine other beauties 
6 Not having the thing which makes them seem short. 7 Pretty, not necessarily blonde… 8 coz – term of companionship, short for cousin. 
ROMEO Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget. 
EXIT BENVOLIO and ROMEO 
SCENE 2 Outside The House of Capulet 
CAPULET and PARIS in conversation 
CAPULET …’tis  not  so  hard  I  think. For men so old as we to keep the peace. 
PARIS Of honourable reckoning are you both, And  pity  ’tis you lived at odds so long.9 But now my lord what say you to my suit? 
CAPULET My child is yet a stranger in the world, She hath not seen the change of fourteen years. 
PARIS Younger than she are happy mothers made. 
CAPULET And too soon marred are those so early made.
[taking him close – offering an alternative]
Such delight among fresh female buds shall you this night Inherit at my house. Come, go with me.10 
EXIT CAPULET and PARIS ENTER BENVOLIO and ROMEO in conversation 
BENVOLIO Why Romeo, art thou mad? 
ROMEO Not mad, but bound more than a madman is: Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipped and tormented and -good  e’en11, good fellow. 
ENTER SERVANT 
SERVANT Good  e’en.  My  master  is  the  great  rich  Capulet,  and  if  you  be not of the house of Montagues I pray come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry. 
SERVANT hands BENVOLIO an invitation. EXIT SERVANT 
ROMEO I’ll  go  along. 
9 Paris wishes  to marryJuliet,  there  is a  certain amount  of ‘sucking up’ to Capulet  here. 10 Capulet  suggests Paris attend the  partytonight  and examine  other beauties to see ifhe  can’t  find 
someone he prefers to Juliet.11 E’en -afternoon

ENTER JULIET  
JULIET  How now, who calls?  
NURSE  Your mother.  
JULIET  Madam, I am here, what is your will?  
LADY CAPULET  Tell me, daughter Juliet,  
How stands your disposition to be married?  
JULIET  It is an honour that I dream not of.  
LADY CAPULET  Well, think of marriage now.  
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.  
This night you shall behold him at our feast.  
NURSE  Madam, the guests are come.  
LADY CAPULET  We follow thee.  
NURSE  Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.  
EXIT NURSE and LADY CAPULET  
SCENE 4  
A street  
ENTER ROMEO, BENVOLIO, MERCUTIO and REVELLERS  
MERCUTIO  Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.  
ROMEO  Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes  
With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead.  
BENVOLIO  Come, knock and enter.12  
ROMEO  But ’tis no wit to go.13  

12 The  partyat  Capulet’s 
13 It is not wise to go. 
MERCUTIO  Why, may one ask?  
ROMEO  I dreamt a dream tonight.  
MERCUTIO  And so did I.  
ROMEO  And what was yours?  
MERCUTIO  That dreamers often lie  
BENVOLIO  [hurrying them along] Supper is done, and we shall come too late.  
ROMEO  I fear too early: for my mind misgives  
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars  
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date  
With  this  night’s  revels.  
EXIT all  
SCENE 5  
Capulet’s  House  
The room is crowded, the people dance and drink. ROMEO and JULIET wind up dancing together beforePARIS spins her away. ROMEO stands downstageawestruck and following her movements. He stops a passing servant.  
ROMEO  What  lady’s  that?  
SERVANT  I know not, sir.  
ROMEO  O she doth teach the torches to burn bright.  
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight.  
For I  ne’er  saw  true  beauty  till  this  night. [He moves to follow her]  
TYBALT  [who has been standing behind ROMEO] This, by his voice, should be a Montague.  
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,  
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.  
CAPULET  Why, how now, kinsman, wherefore storm you so?  
TYBALT  Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe:  
A villain that is hither come in spite  
To scorn at our solemnity this night.  

CAPULET Young Romeo is it? Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone. TYBALT I’ll  not  endure  him. CAPULET He shall be endured. Am I the master here or you? Go to. TYBALT Why,  uncle,  ’tis a shame. 
EXIT TYBALT 
ROMEO [Taking JULIET by the hand] If I profane with my unworthiest hand This shrine, the gentle fine14 is this: To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. 
JULIET Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; 
For  saints  have  hands  that  pilgrims’  hands  do  touch,  And  palm  to  palm  is  holy  palmers’  kiss. 
ROMEO Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? JULIET Ay, lips that they must use in prayer. ROMEO O then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do! 
They pray.15 
THEY KISS 
JULIET You kiss by the book. NURSE Madam, your mother craves a word with you. 
EXIT JULIET 
ROMEO What is her mother? NURSE Her mother is the lady of the house. 
EXIT NURSE ROMEO [Staring after her] Is she a Capulet? BENVOLIO [Catching ROMEO by the arm] Away, be gone; the sport is 
at the best. 
14 The  punishment  for touchingJuliet’s hand is to kissit. 
15 Romeo compares hands held together in prayer and lips held together when kissing. It would be illustrative to the audience if the couple held hands palm to palm. 
ROMEO  Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.  
CAPULET  [Addressing the entire room] I thank you all; I thank you honest gentlemen, goodnight. By my fay, it waxes late.  
The REVELLERS begin to disperse. ENTER JULIET andNURSE  
JULIET  Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?  
NURSE  His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy.  
JULIET  My only love sprung from my only hate. Too early seen unknown, and known too late.  
EXIT all  
SCENE 6 Outside the walls of the House of Capulet  
ROMEO hides. ENTER BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO  
BENVOLIO  Romeo! My cousin, Romeo! Romeo! He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.[giving up]Come, Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.  
MERCUTIO  If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.  
BENVOLIO  Go  then,  for  ’tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found.  
EXIT MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO  
SCENE 7 Capulet’s  Orchard  ROMEO hides  
ROMEO  He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun! It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!  
JULIET appears at her balcony  

JULIET Ay me! 
ROMEO She speaks. O, speak again bright angel! 
JULIET O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?16 Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And  I’ll  no  longer  be a  Capulet. 
ROMEO Shall I hear more, or speak at this? 
JULIET ’Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. O, be some other name. 
What’s  in  a  name?  That  which  we  call  a  rose 
By any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called. Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself. 
ROMEO [emerging from his hiding place] I take thee at thy word. Call me but love, and henceforth I never will be Romeo. 
JULIET [shocked] Art thou not a Montague? 
How  cam’st  thou  hither,  tell  me,  and  wherefore? 
ROMEO With  love’s  light  wings  did  I  o’erperch  these  walls. 
JULIET If any of my kinsmen find thee here they will murder thee. 
ROMEO I  have  night’s  cloak  to  hide  me  from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here.17 My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. 
JULIET Dost thou love me? O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. 
ROMEO Lady by yonder blessed moon I vow. 
JULIET O swear not by the moon, 
ROMEO What shall I swear by? 
16 ‘Wherefore’ in thiscontext  means ‘why’. She  isasking why the  man she  loves must  be  Romeo, the  
Montague.
17 Unless you love  me, let  them find me, I’d rather die  thanlive  without  your love. 
JULIET  Do not swear at all. Or if thou wilt- 
NURSE  (calling from within) Madam!  
JULIET  Anon good nurse!  
Three words good Romeo, and goodnight indeed.  
If that thy bent of love be honourable,  
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,  
And  all  my  fortunes  at  thy foot  I’ll  lay,   
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.  
NURSE  Madam!  
JULIET  By and by, I come!  
Tomorrow will I send.  
ROMEO  So thrive my soul  
JULIET  A thousand times good night.  
EXIT JULIET  
ROMEO  Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books,  
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

Cell  
FRIAR LAWRENCE in his cell  
ENTER ROMEO  
ROMEO  Good morrow father!  
FRIAR LAWRENCE  [startled] Benedicite!  
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.  
God pardon sin, wast thou with Rosaline?  
ROMEO  With Rosaline, my ghostly18 father? No.  
I  have  forgot  that  name,  and  that  name’s  woe.  
FRIAR LAWRENCE  That’s  my good  son;;  but  be  plain,  where  hast  thou  been   
then?  
ROMEO  Then plainly  know  my  heart’s  dear  love  is  set  
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.  
We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow,  
I’ll  tell  thee as  we  pass;;  but  this I  pray,  

18 Spiritual rather than supernatural 
That thou consent to marry us today. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE  Holy Saint Francis!  
ROMEO  I pray thee chide me not.  
FRIAR LAWRENCE  Come,  
In  one  respect  I’ll  thy  assistant  be;;  
For this alliance may so happy prove To  turn  your  households’  rancour to pure love.19  
EXIT both  
SCENE 9  
A street  
ENTER MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO  
MERCUTIO  Where the devil should this Romeo be?  
Came he not home tonight?  
BENVOLIO  Not to his father’s. I spoke with his man.  
ENTER ROMEO. The two turn their backs on him  
ROMEO  Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?  
MERCUTIO  The slip, sir, the slip.  
ROMEO  Pardon, good Mercutio; my business was great.  
MERCUTIO  [Noting  Romeo’s  good  mood]Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?  
[ENTER NURSE]  
God ye good den20, fair gentlewoman.  
NURSE  Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the  
young Romeo?  
ROMEO  I can tell you; I am the youngest of that name.  
NURSE  If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.  
ROMEO  [to MERCUTIO] I will follow you.  
MERCUTIO  Farewell ancient lady.  

19 I willl help you for one reason; your marriage may reconcile your feuding families. 20 Good afternoon. 
EXIT MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO 
NURSE  First  let  me  tell  ye,  if  ye  should  lead  her  in  a fool’s  paradise,   
as they say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, truly it  
were an ill thing- 
ROMEO  I protest unto thee –  
Bid her to come to shrift this afternoon,  
And  there  she  shall  at  Friar  Lawrence’s  cell  
Be shrived 21and married.  
NURSE  She shall be there.  
EXIT both  
SCENE 10  
Capulet’s  house.  JULIET awaits her nurse  
ENTER NURSE  
JULIET  O honey nurse, what news?  
NURSE  I am a-weary, give me leave a while.  
JULIET  Come, I pray thee, speak.  
NURSE  Do you not see that I am out of breath?  
JULIET  How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath  
To say to me that thou art out of breath?  
Is thy news good, or bad? Answer to that.  
NURSE  [Giving in] Your love says like an honest gentleman – Where is your mother?  
JULIET  Where is my mother? How oddly thou repliest!  
Come, what says Romeo?  
NURSE  Hie you  hence  to  Friar  Lawrence’  cell.  
There stays a husband to make you a wife!  
EXIT JULIET and NURSE separately  
SCENE 11  
Friar  Lawrence’  Cell  

21 Shrift was confession. Shrived meant the act of confession which was required before receiving the sacrament of marriage. 
ROMEO waits with FRIAR LAWRENCE in a single spotlight. JULIET ENTERS with NURSE by her side. JULIET joins ROMEO, they join hands and gaze into each  other’s  eyes.  
FRIAR LAWRENCE  So smile the heavens upon this holy act That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.  
They kiss.  
SCENE 12 A street  EXIT all ENTER BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO  
BENVOLIO  I pray you, good Mercutio, lets retire; The day is hot, the Capels22 are abroad, And  if  we  meet  we  shall  not  ’scape a brawl, By my head, here come the Capulets.  
MERCUTIO  By my heel, I care not.  
ENTER TYBALT and others  
TYBALT  Gentlemen,  good  e’en: a word with one of you.  
MERCUTIO  And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.  
TYBALT  You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.  
MERCUTIO  Consort?23 What, dost that make us minstrels?  
ENTER ROMEO now secretly married and thereforerelated to the Capulets.  
TYBALT  Well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man. Romeo! The love I bear thee can afford No better term than this: thou art a villain.  
ROMEO  Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse such a greeting: villain am I none.  
TYBALT  Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries thou hast done me.  
ROMEO  I do protest I never injured thee.  

22 Capulets 23 To consort is to associate with. A consort is a group of musicians – Mercutio puns on the word to argue with Tybalt. 
And so, good Capulet, which name I tender As dearly as mine own, be satisfied. 
MERCUTIO O calm, dishonourable, vile submission! [He draws] Tybalt, you rat catcher24, will you walk? 
TYBALT What wouldst thou have with me? MERCUTIO Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. TYBALT I am for you. [He draws] ROMEO Gentle Mercutio ­
They fight. MERCUTIO  is the better swordsman, TYBALT is struggling to keep up. 
ROMEO Tybalt! Mercutio! The Prince expressly hath Forbid this. Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio! 
TYBALT under  ROMEO’s  arm  wounds  MERCUTIO 
BENVOLIO Art thou hurt? MERCUTIO Ay, ay,  a  scratch,  a  scratch.  Marry,  ’tis enough. ROMEO Courage man, the hurt cannot be much. MERCUTIO ’Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a 
grave man. A plague  o’  both  your  houses.  A  plague  o’  both  your  houses. 
MERCUTIO dies 
BENVOLIO Here comes Tybalt. ROMEO Alive, in triumph, and Mercutio slain. 
Tybalt,  Mercutio’s  soul 
Is but a little way above our heads, Staying for thine to keep him company. Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.25 
TYBALT Thou, wretched boy, shalt with him hence. 
They FIGHT. ROMEO kills TYBALT 
24 Tybalt  is known as ‘the  Prince  ofCats’. Mercutio reduces this name  to a  catcher ofvermin and 
nothing else.25 Mercutio’s soul  has  not  yet  left  the  earth, he  waits for yours to keep himcompany. Either yoursor mine, or both must go with him – i.e. either you, I or both of us die.

Where are the vile beginners of this fray? 
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. 
Tybalt, my  cousin,  O  my  brother’s  child! O, the blood is spilled Of my dear kinsman. Prince, as thou art true, For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague. 
Romeo spoke him fair. 
Tybalt,  deaf  to  peace,  tilts  at  bold  Mercutio’s  breast. 
Romeo, he cries aloud And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm Tybalt hit the life of stout Mercutio. 
He is a kinsman to the Montague. Affection makes him false. He speaks not true. I beg for Justice, which thou, Prince, must give. Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live. 
For that offence Immediately we do exile him hence. Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he is found, that hour will be his last. 
EXIT all 
JULIET awaits news from her nurse 
Come, gentle night, give me my Romeo. O, I have bought the mansion of a love But not yet possessed it, and though I am sold, Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day! 
ENTER NURSE 
Now, Nurse, what news? 
NURSE  We are undone, lady, we are undone. Alack  the  day,  he’s  gone,  he’s  killed,  he’s  dead.  
JULIET  What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus? Hath Romeo slain himself?  
NURSE  Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished. Romeo that killed him, he is banished.  
JULIET  O  God!  Did  Romeo’s  hand  shed  Tybalt’s  blood? O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face! Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? O that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace!  
NURSE  Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?  
JULIET  Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband? Tybalt is dead and Romeo – banished. That  ‘banished’,  that  one  word  ‘banished’ Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts.  
O find him, give this ring to my true knight And bid him come to take his last farewell.

FRIAR LAWRENCE  This is dear mercy and thou seest it not.  
ROMEO  ’Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here Where Juliet lives, and every unworthy thing, Live here in heaven and may look on her, But Romeo may not.

ROMEO  It was the lark, the herald of the morn. I must be gone and live, or stay and die.  
JULIET  Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I. Thou  need’st  not  be gone.  
ROMEO  Let me  be  ta’en,  let  me  be  put  to  death. I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How  is’t,  my  soul?  Let’s  talk.  It  is  not  day.

Madam, in happy time. What day is that? 
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn The gallant Paris shall happily make thee a joyful bride. 
He shall not make me a joyful bride! I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, I will not marry yet. And when I do, I swear It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris. 
[shocked] Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands. 
ENTER CAPULET 
Sir, she will none, she gives you thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave. 
How? Will she none? Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? 
Go  with  Paris  to  Saint  Peter’s  Church,

EXIT LADY CAPULET without looking at JULIET 
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself. What sayst thou? 
NURSE  Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing.  
I think you are happy in this second match,  
For it excels your first; or, if it did not,  
Your  first  is  dead,  or  ’twere as good he were.  
JULIET  [Pause]  
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,  
Having  displeased  my  father,  to  Lawrence’  cell,   
To make confession and to be absolved.  
NURSE  Marry,  I  will,  and  ’tis wisely done.  
EXIT NURSE  
JULIET  Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend,  
I’ll  to  the  Friar, to know his remedy.  
If all else fail, myself have the power to die.

PARIS  …Now  do  you  know  the reason  of  this  haste  
FRIAR LAWRENCE  [to himself] I would I knew not why it should be slowed.28  
Look sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.  
ENTER JULIET  
PARIS  Happily met, my lady and my wife.  
JULIET  That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.  
PARIS  That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.  
JULIET  What must be shall be.  
FRIAR LAWRENCE  That’s  a  certain  text.  
PARIS  Come you to make confession to this father?  
JULIET  To answer that, I should confess to you. [to FRIAR LAWRENCE] Are you at leisure, holy father  
now?

My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. My lord, we must entreat the time alone. 
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye. Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. 
They kiss. EXIT PARIS 
O shut the door, 
God  joined  my  heart  and  Romeo’s,  thou  our  hands;; 
Give me some present counsel, I long to die 
If  what  thou  speak’st  speak  not  of  remedy. 
I do spy a kind of hope. If, rather than to marry County Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame. 
I will do it without fear or doubt. To live an unstained wife to my sweet love. 
Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent To marry Paris. Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilling liquor drink thou off; When presently through all thy veins shall run No pulse, no warmth. The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death Thou shall continue two and forty hours, And then awake as from pleasant sleep. Thou shall be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift And hither shall he come. 
Love, give me strength and strength shall help afford. Farewell, dear father!

Gentle Nurse, I pray thee, leave me to myself tonight. 
Good night. Get thee to bed, and rest, for thou hast need. 
EXIT LADY CAPULET and NURSE 
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again. What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning? No, no, this shall forbid it. [she lays down a knife] Romeo, I come! This I do drink to thee.

ENTER BALTHAZAR 
News from Verona! How now Balthazar, Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar? How doth my lady? For nothing can be ill if she be well.

ROMEO  [PAUSE] Is  it  e’en  so?  Then  I defy you, stars! I will hence tonight.  
BALTHAZAR  I do beseech you sir, have patience.

BALTHAZAR  No my good lord.

EXIT BALTHAZAR  
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.  
Crossing the stage and banging on a door  
What ho! Apothecary! Come hither man. I see that thou art poor. Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have A dram of poison.  
APOTHECARY  Such mortal  drugs  I  have,  but  Mantua’s  law Is death to any he that utters them. My poverty, but not my will, consents.

ROMEO  O my love, my wife, Death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath Hath no power yet upon thy beauty. Thou  art  not  conquered.  Beauty’s  ensign  yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And  death’s  pale  flag  is  not  advanced  there. Dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair? O here will I set up my everlasting rest.

ROMEO falls. JULIET rises. 
[seeing Romeo] Romeo! 
What’s  here  closed  in  my  true  love’s  hand? 
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. O churl! Drunk all, and left no friendly drop To help me after? I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them. [she kisses him] 
Movement is heard outside the tomb 
Yea noise? O happy dagger. This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.

What misadventure is so early up, That calls our person from our morning rest? 
ENTER CAPULET and LADY CAPULET 
What should it be, that is so shrieked abroad? 
O  the  people  in  the  street  cry  ‘Romeo’ And some  ‘Juliet’… 
They stare at the scene. ENTER MONTAGUE. FRIAR LAWRENCE kneels and prays beside the bodies. 
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight. 
Grief  of  my  son’s  exile  hath  stopped  her  breath. 
What further woe conspires against mine age? [he sees ROMEO and JULIET and falls silent] 
PRINCE Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague, See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love; And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished. 
CAPULET O brother Montague, give me thy hand. 
MONTAGUE There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet.29 
CAPULET As  rich  shall  Romeo’s  by  his  lady’s  lie, Poor sacrifices of our enmity.

THE END
