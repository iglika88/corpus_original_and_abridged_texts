
CHARACI.RS 
Romeo--The son and heir ofMontague and Lady Montague. A young man ofabout sixteen, Romeo is handsome, intelligent, and sensitive. Though impulsive and immature, his idealism and passion make him an extremely likable character. Helives in the middle of a violent feud between his family and the Capulets, but he is not at all interested in violence. His only interest is love and he goes to extremes to prove the serious­ness ofhis feelings. He secretly marries Juliet, the daughter of his father's worst enemy; he happily takes abuse from Tybalt; and he would rather die than live without his beloved. Romeo is also an affectionate and devoted friend to his relative Ben­volio, Mercutio, and Friar Lawrence. 
Juliet -The daughter ofCapulet and Lady Capulet. A beautiful thirteen-year-old girl, Juliet begins the playas a naIve child who has thought little about love and marriage, but she grows up quickly upon falling in love with Romeo, the son of her family's great enemy. Because she is a girl in an aristocratic family, she has none of the freedom Romeo has to roam around the city, climb over walls in the middle ofthe night, or get into swordfights. Nevertheless, she shows amazing cour­age in trusting her entire life and future to Romeo, even refus­ing to believe the worst reports about him after he gets involved in a fight with her cousin. Juliet's closest friend and confidant is her Nurse, though she's willing to shut the Nurse out ofher life the moment the Nurse turns against Romeo. 
Friar Lawrence--A Franciscan friar, friend to both Romeo and Juliet. Kind, civic-minded, a proponent of moderation, and always ready with a plan, Friar Lawrence secretly marries the impassioned lovers in hopes that the union might eventually

bring peace to Verona. As well as being a Catholic holy man, Friar Lawrence is also an expert in the use ofseemingly mys­tical potions and herbs. 
Mercutio-A kinsman to the Prince, and Romeo's close friend. One ofthe most extraordinary characters in all ofShakes­peare's plays, Mercutio overflows with imagination, wit, and, at times, a strange, biting satire and brooding fervor. Mercutio loves wordplay, especially sexual double enten­dres. He can be quite hotheaded, and hates people who are affected, pretentious, or obsessed with the latest fashions. He finds Romeo's romanticized ideas about love tiresome, and tries to convince Romeo to view love as a simple matter of sexual appetite. 
The Nurse-Juliet's nurse, the woman who breast-fed Juliet when she was a baby and has cared for Juliet her entire life. A vulgar, long-winded, and sentimental character, the Nurse provides comic relief with her frequently inappropriate remarks and speeches. But, until a disagreement near the play's end, the Nurse is Juliet's faithful confidante and loyal intermediary in Juliet's affair with Romeo. She provides a contrast with Juliet, given that her view oflove is earthy and sexual, whereas Juliet is idealistic and intense. The Nurse believes in love and wants Juliet to have a nice-looking hus­band, but the idea that Juliet would want to sacrifice herself for love is incomprehensible to her. 
Tybalt-A Capulet, Juliet's cousin on her mother's side. Vain, fashionable, supremely aware of courtesy and the lack of it, he becomes aggressive, violent, and quick to draw his sword when he feels his pride has been injured. Once drawn, his sword is something to be feared. He loathes Montagues. 
x 
Capulet-The patriarch of the Capulet family, father ofJuliet, husband of Lady Capulet, and enemy, for unexplained rea­sons, ofMontague. He truly loves his daughter, though he is not well acquainted with Juliet's thoughts or feelings, and seems to think that what is best for her is a ..good" match with Paris. Often prudent, he commands respect and propriety, but he is liable to fly into a rage when either is lacking. 
Lady Capulet-Juliet's mother, Capulet's wife. A woman who herself married young (by her own estimation she gave birth to Juliet at close to the age offourteen), she is eager to see her daughter marry Paris. She is an ineffectual mother, relying on the Nurse for moral and pragmatic support. 
Montague-Romeo's father, the patriarch ofthe Montague clan and bitter enemy ofCapulet. At the beginning ofthe play, he is chiefly concerned about Romeo's melancholy. 
Lady Montague-Romeo's mother, Montague's wife. She dies ofgrief after Romeo is exiled from Verona. 
Paris-A kinsman ofthe Prince, and the suitor ofJuliet most pre­ferred by Capulet. Once Capulet has promised him he can marryJuliet, he behaves very presumptuous toward, acting as if they are already married. 
Benvolio--Montague's nephew, Romeo's cousin and thoughtful friend, he makes a genuine effort to defuse violent scenes in public places, though Mercutio accuses him ofhaving a nasty temper in private. He spends most ofthe play trying to help Romeo get his mind offRosaline, even after Romeo has fallen in love with Juliet. 
Prince Escalus-The Prince oNerona. A kinsman ofMercutio and Paris. As the seat ofpolitical power in Verona, he is con­cerned about maintaining the public peace at all costs.

'., . 
" . 
Friar John-A Franciscan friar charged by Friar Lawrence with taking the news ofJuliet's false death to Romeo in Mantua. Friar John is held up in a quarantined house, and the message never reaches Romeo. 
Balthasar-Romeo's dedicated servant, who brings Romeo the news ofJuliet's death, unaware that her death is a ruse. 
Sampson and Gregory-Two servants ofthe house ofCapulet, who, like their master, hate the Montagues. At the outset of the play, they successfully provoke some Montague men into a fight. 
Abraham-Montague's servant, who fights with Sampson and Gregory in the first scene of the play. 
The Apothecary-An apothecary in Mantua. Had he been wealthier, he might have been able to afford to value his mor­als more than money, and refused to sell poison to Romeo. 
Peter-A Capulet servant who invites guests to Capulet's feast and escorts the Nurse to meet with Romeo. He is illiterate, and a bad singer. 
Rosaline-The woman with whom Romeo is infatuated at the beginning ofthe play. Rosaline never appears onstage, but it is said by other characters that she is very beautiful and has sworn to live a life of chastity. 
The Chorus-The Chorus is a single character who functions as a narrator offering commentary on the play's plot and themes.

CHORUS 
Two households, both alike in dignity 
(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene), 
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, 
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. 
From forth the fatal loins ofthese two foes s A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life, 
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows 
Doth with their death bury their parents' strife. 
The fearful passage of their death -marked love 
And the continuance oftheir parents' rage, 
Which, but their children's end, naught could remove, 
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage-
The which, if you with patient ears attend, 
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

The CHORUB enters. 
CHORUB 
In the beautiful city ofVerona, where our story takes place, a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence, and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens. Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lov­ers and commit suicide. Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents' feud. For the next two hours, we will watch the story oftheir doomed love and their parents' anger, which nothing but the children's deaths could stop. If you listen to us patiently, we'll make up for everything we've left out in this prologue onstage.

The fight is between our masters, and we men who work for them. 
It's all the same. I'll be a harsh master to them. After I fight the men, I'll be nice to the women-I'll cut off their heads.

Cut off their heads, take their maidenheads-what­ever. Take my remark in whichever sense you like.

Three civil brawls, bred ofan airy word, By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturbed the quiet ofour streets And made Verona's ancient citizens Cast by their grave-beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans in hands as old, Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate.

Here were the servants ofyour adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I did approach. I drew to part them. In the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, He swung about his head and cut the winds, Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn. While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part. 
LADY MONTAGUE 
Oh, where is Romeo? Saw you him today? Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun Peered forth the golden window of the east, A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad, Where, underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from this city side, So early walking did I see your son. Towards him I made, but he was 'ware ofme And stole into the covert of the wood. I, measuring his affections by my own, Which then most sought where most might not be found, Being one too many by my weary self, Pursued my humor not pursuing his, And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.

Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.

Underneath the Sycamore grove that grows on the west side ofthe city, I saw your son taking an early -morning walk. I headed toward him, but he saw me coming and hid in the woods. I thought he must be feeling the same way I was-wanting to be alone and tired of his own com­pany. I figured he was avoiding me, and I was perfectly happy to leave him alone and keep to myself. 
He's been seen there many mornings, crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs. But as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son comes home to escape the light.

He locks himself up alone in his bedroom, shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight, and makes himself an artificial night. This mood of his is going to bring bad news, unless someone smart can fix what's bothering him. 
My noble uncle, do you know why he acts this way? 
I don't know, and he won't tell me. 
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason? 
I've tried, and many ofour friends have tried to make him talk, but he keeps his thoughts to himself. He doesn't want any friend but himself, and though I don't know whether he's a good friend to himself, he certainly keeps his own secrets. He's like a flower bud that won't open itself up to the world because it's been poisoned from within by parasites, If we could only find out why he's sad, we'd be as eager to help him as we were to learn the reason for his sadness.

Why, such is love's transgression. Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, Which thou wilt propagate, to have it pressed With more ofthine. This love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much ofmine own. Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs; Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears. What is it else? A madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. Farewell, my coz. 
BENVOLIO 
Soft! I will go along. And ifyou leave me so, you do me wrong. 
ROMEO 
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here. This is not Romeo. He's some other where. 
BENVOLIO 
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love. 
ROMEO 
What, shall I groan and tell thee? 
BENVOLIO 
Groan! Why, no. But sadly, tell me who.

everything except what it is! This is the love I feel, though no one loves me back. Are you laughing? 
No, cousin, I'm crying. 
Good man, why are you crying? 
I'm crying because of how sad you are. 
Yes, this is what love does. My sadness sits heavy in my chest, and you want to add your own sadness to mine so there's even more. I have too much sadness already, and now you're going to make me sadder by feeling sorry for you. Here's what love is: a smoke made out oflovers' sighs. When the smoke clears, love is a fire burning in your lover's eyes. Ifyou frustrate love, you get an ocean made out oflovers' tears. What else is love? It's a wise form of madness. It's a sweet lozenge that you choke on. Goodbye, cousin. 
Wait. I'll come with you. If you leave me like this, you're doing me wrong. 
I'm not myself. I'm not here. This isn't Romeo-he's somewhere else. 
Tell me seriously, who is the one you love? 
Seriously? You mean I should groan and tell you?

A right good markman! And she's fair I love. 
BENVOLIO 
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. 
ROMEO 
Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit. And, in strong proof of chastity well armed From love's weak childish bow, she lives uncharmed. She will not stay the siege ofloving terms, Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold. Oh, she is rich in beauty, only poor That when she dies, with beauty dies her store. 
BENVOLIO 
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? 
ROMEO 
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty, starved with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity. She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair. She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

You wouldn't tell a sick man he "seriously" has to make his will-it would just make him worse. Seri­ously, cousin, I love a woman, 
I guessed that already when I guessed you were in love, 
Then you were right on target, The woman I love is beautiful. 
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest, 
Well, you're not on target there. She refuses to be hit by Cupid's arrow, She's as clever as Diana, and shielded by the armor ofchastity. She can't be touched by the weak and childish arrows oflove. She won't lis­ten to words oflove, or let you look at her with loving eyes, or open her lap to receive gifts of gold. She's rich in beauty, but she's also POOf, because when she dies her beauty will be destroyed with her. 
So she's made a vow to be a virgin forever? 
Yes she has, and by keeping celibate, she wastes her beauty. If you starve yourself of sex you can't ever have children, and so your beauty is lost to future gen­erations, She's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair. She's sworn off love, and that promise has left me alive but dead, living only to talk about it now,

Whether it's even or odd, ofall the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she'll be fourteen. She and Susan-God rest her and all Christian souls-were born on the same day. Well, Susan died and is with God. She was too good for me. But like I said, on the night of Lammas Eve, she will be fourteen. Yes, she will. Indeed, I remember it well. It's been eleven years since the earthquake. She stopped nursing from my breast on that very day. I'll never forget it. I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun, under the wall of the dovehouse. You and your husband were in Mantua. Boy, do I have some mem­ory! But like I said, when she tasted the bitter worm­wood on my nipple, the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast. Then the dove­house shook with the earthquake. There was no need to tell me to get out of there. That was eleven years ago. By then she could stand up all by herself. No, I swear, by that time she could run and waddle all around. I remember because she had cut her forehead just the day before. My husband-God rest his soul, he was a happy man-picked up the child. "Oh," he said, "Did you fall on your face? You'll fall backward when you grow smarter. Won't you, Jule." And I swear, the poor pretty thing stopped crying and said, "Yes." Oh, to watch a joke come true! I bet if I live a thousand years, I'll never forget it. "Won't you, Jule," he said. And the pretty fool stopped crying and said,

Examine every line of his features and see how they work together to make him handsome. Ifyou are confused, just look into his eyes. This man is single, and he lacks only a bride to make him perfect and complete. As is right, fish live in the sea, and it's wrong for a beauty like you to hide from a handsome man like him. Many people think he's handsome, and whoever becomes his bride will be just as admired. You would share all that he possesses, and by having him, you would lose nothing.

What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? Or shall we on without apology? 
BENVOLIO 
The date is out of such prolixity. We'll have no Cupid hoodwinked with a scarf, Bearing a Tartar's painted bow oflath, Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper, Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke After the prompter for our entrance. But let them measure us by what they will. We'll measure them a measure and be gone.

Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling. Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. 
ROMEO 
Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes With nimble sales. I have a soul oElead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. 
MERCUTIO 
You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound.

I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers, and so bound, I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

ROMEO 
What will we say is our excuse for being here? Or should we enter without apologizing? 
BENVOLIO 
It's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that. We're not going to introduce our dance by hav­ing someone dress up as Cupid, blindfolded and car­rying a toy bow to frighten the ladies like a scarecrow. Nor are we going to recite a memorized speech to introduce ourselves. Let them judge us however they please. We'll give them a dance and then hit the road. 
ROMEO 
Give me a torch. I don't want to dance. I feel sad, so let me be the one who carries the light.

MERCUTIO 
You're a lover. Take Cupid's wings and fly higher than the average man. 
ROMEO 
His arrow has pierced me too deeply, so I can't fly high with his cheerful feathers. Because this wound keeps me down, I can't leap any higher than my dull sad­ness. I sink under the heavy weight of love.

She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate stone On the forefinger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomi Over men's noses as they lie asleep. Her wagon spokes made oflong spinners' legs, The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, Her traces ofthe smallest spider's web, Her collars ofthe moonshine's watery beams, Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film, Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.

Why, may I ask?

My dream told me that dreamers often lie. 
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth. 
Oh, then I see you've been with Queen Mab. 
Who's Queen Mab? 
She's the fairies' midwife. She's no bigger than the stone on a city councilman's ring. She rides around in a wagon drawn by tiny little atoms, and she rides over men's noses as they lie sleeping. The spokes of her wagon are made of spiders' legs, The cover of her wagon is made ofgrasshoppers' wings. The harnesses are made of the smallest spiderwebs. The collars are made out of moonbeams. Her whip is a thread attached to a cricket's bone. Her wagon driver is a tiny bug in a gray coat; he's not halfthe size ofa little round worm that comes from the finger ofa lazy young girl.

And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream oflove; On courtiers' knees, that dream on curtsies straight; 0'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees; O 'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, And then dreams he ofsmelling out a suit . And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep, Then he dreams ofanother benefice.

This is that very Mab That plaits the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes.

Her chariot is a hazelnut shell. It was made by a car­penter squirrel or an old grubworm; they've made wagons for the fairies as long as anyone can remem­ber. In this royal wagon, she rides every nightthrough the brains oflovers and makes them dream about love. She rides over courtiers' knees, and they dream about curtsying. She rides over lawyers' fingers, and right away, they dream about their fees. She rides over ladies' lips, and they immediately dream of kisses. Queen Mab often puts blisters on their lips because their breath smells like candy, which makes her mad. Sometimes she rides over a courtier's lips, and he dreams of making money off ofsomeone. Sometimes she tickles a priest's nose with a tithe-pigs tail, and he dreams ofa large donation. Sometimes she rides over a soldier's neck, and he dreams ofcutting the throats of foreign enemies, of breaking down walls, of ambushes, ofSpanish swords, and ofenormous cups of liquor. And then, drums beat in his ear and he wakes up. He's frightened, so he says a couple of prayers and goes back to sleep. She is the same Mab who tangles the hair in horses' manes at night and makes the tangles hard in the dirty hairs, which bring bad luck ifthey're untangled. Mab is the old hag who gives false sex dreams to virgins and teaches them how to hold a lover and bear a child. She's the one-

(to himself) Is she a Capulet? Oh, this is a heavy price to pay! My life is in the hands of my enemy. 
(to ROMEO) Come on, let's go. Right when things are the most fun is the best time to leave. 
Yes, but I'm afraid I'm in more trouble than ever. 
No gentlemen, don't get ready to go now. We have a little dessert coming up. (they whisper in his ear) Is that really true? Well, then, I thank you both. I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night. Bring more torches over here! Come on, let's all get to bed. (to his COUSIN) Ah, my man, I swear, it's getting late. I'm going to get some rest.

Come over here, nurse. Who is that gentleman? 
NURSE 
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio. 
JULIET 
Who's the one who's going out the door right now? 
NURSE 
Well, that one, I think, is young Petruchio. 
JULIET 
Who's the one following over there, the one who wouldn't dance? 
NURSE 
I don't know his name. 
JULIET 
Go ask. (the nurse leaves) Ifhe's married, I think I'll die rather than marry anyone else. 
NURSE 
(returning) His name is Romeo. He's a Montague. He's the only son of your worst enemy. 
JULIET 
(to herself) The only man I love is the son of the only man I hate! I saw him too early without knowing who he was, and I found out who he was too late! Love is a monster for making me fall in love with my worst enemy. 
NURSE 
What's this? What's this?

Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie, And young affection gapes to be his heir. That fair for which love groaned for and would die With tender Juliet matched, is now not fair. 
.' Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike bewitched by the charm oflooks, But to his foe supposed he must complain, And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks. Being held a foe, he may not have access

ACT TWO 
PROLOGUE 
The CHORUS enters. 
CHORUS 
Now Romeo's old feelings of desire are dying, and a new desire is eager to take their place. Romeo groaned for the beautiful Rosaline and said he would die for her, but compared with tender Juliet, Rosaline doesn't seem beautiful now. Now someone loves Romeo, and he's in love again-both of them falling for each others' good looks. But he has to make his speeches oflove to a woman who's supposed to be his enemy. And she's been hooked by someone she should fear. Because he's an enemy, Romeo has no chance to see Juliet and say the things a lover normally says. And Juliet's just as much in love as he, but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover. But love gives them power, and time gives them the chance to meet, sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure.

Itisn't a hand, a foot, an arm, a face, or any other part of a man. Oh, be some other name! What does a name mean? The thing we call a rose would smell just as sweet if we called it by any other name. Romeo would be just as perfect even if he wasn't called Romeo. Romeo, lose your name. Trade in your name-which really has nothing to do with you-and take all of me in exchange.

By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word.

Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike .

How earnest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

With love's light wings did I 0'erperch these walls, For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

I haven't heard you say a hundred words yet, but I rec­ognize the sound of your voice. Aren't you Romeo? And aren't you a Montague? 
ROMEO 
I am neither ofthose things ifyou dislike them.

Tell me, how did you get in here? And why did you come? The orchard walls are high, and it's hard to climb over them. Ifany of my relatives find you here they'll kill you because ofwho you are.

I flew over these walls with the light wings of love. Stone walls can't keep love out. Whatever a man in love can possibly do, his love will make him try to do it. Therefore your relatives are no obstacle.

Alas, one angry look from you would be worse than twenty of your relatives with swords. Just look at me kindly, and I'm invincible against their hatred.

My soul is calling out my name. The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver­sweet. It's the sweetest sound a lover ever hears.

'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone. 
And yet no further than a wanton's bird, 
That lets it hop a little from his hand 
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, 
And with a silken thread plucks it back again, 
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

FRIAR LAWRENCE 
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks oflight. And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels. Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. The earth, that's nature's mother, is her tomb. What is her burying, grave that is her womb. And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find, Many for many virtues excellent, None but for some and yet all different. Oh, mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities. For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give. Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse. Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, And vice sometime by action dignified. 
Enter ROMEO 
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power. For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart. Two such opposed kings encamp them still, In man as well as herbs-grace and rude will.

FRIAR LAWRENCE 
The smiling morning is replacing the frowning night. Darkness is stumbling out of the sun's path like a drunk man. Now, before the sun comes up and burns away the dew, I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers. The Earth is nature's mother and also nature's tomb. Plants are born out ofthe Earth, and they are buried in the Earth when they die. From the Earth's womb, many differ­ent sorts of plants and animals come forth, and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms ofnourishment. Evertything nature creates has some special property, and each one is different. Herbs, plants, and stones possess great power. There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not pro­vide the earth with some special quality. And there is nothing that does not turn bad ifit's put to the wrong use and abused. Virtue turns to vice if it's misused. Vice sometimes becomes virtue through the right activity. 
ROMEO enters. 
Inside the little rind of this weak flower, there is both poison and powerful medicine. Ifyou smell it, you feel good all over your body. But if you taste it, you die. There are two opposite elements in everything, in men as well as in herbs-good and evil.

Benedicite. What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? Young son, it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie. But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign . Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature. Or if not so, then here I hit it right: Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight. 
ROMEO 
That last is true. The sweeter rest was mine. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline? 
ROMEO 
With Rosaline, my ghostly Father? No. I have forgot that name and that name's woe. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
That's my good son. But where hast thou been, then? 
ROMEO 
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again. I have been feasting with mine enemy, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me, That's by me wounded. Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies. I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, 10, My intercession likewise steads my foe.

When evil is dominant, death soon kills the body like cancer. 
ROMEO 
Good morning, father. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
God bless you. Who greets me so early in the morn­ing? Young man, something's wrong if you're getting out of bed this early. Every old man has worries, and worried men never get any sleep, but young men shouldn't have a care in the world. They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep. Therefore, the fact that you're awake this early tells me you've been upset with some anxiety. If that's not the case, then this must be the answer: You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight. 
ROMEO 
Your last guess is right. I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
May God forgive you if you've sinned!-Were you with Rosaline? 
ROMEO 
With Rosaline, father? No, I have forgotten that girl and all the sadness she brought me. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
That's good, my boy. But where have you been? 
ROMEO 
I'll tell you before you have to ask me again. I have been feasting with my enemy. Suddenly someone wounded me with love and was wounded with love by me. You have the sacred power to cure both of us. I carry no hatred, holy man, because my request will benefit my enemy.

Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet. As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, And all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage. When and where and how We met, we wooed and made exchange of vow, I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray: That thou consent to marry us today. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! How much salt water thrown away in waste To season love that of it doth not taste! The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears. Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Ofan old tear that is not washed off yet. Ife' er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline. And art thou changed? Pronounce this sentence then: Women may fall when there's no strength in men.

I love rich Capulet's daughter. I love her, and she loves me. We're bound to each other in every possible way, except we need you to marry us. I'll tell you more later about when and where we met, how we fell in love, and how we exchanged promises, but now I'm begging you: please, agree to marry us today. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
Holy Saint Francis, this is a drastic change! Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline, whom you loved so much? Then young men love with their eyes, not with their hearts. Jesus and Mary, how many tears did you cry for Rosaline? How many salty tear-drops did you waste salting a love you never tasted? The sun hasn't yet melted away the fog you made with all your sighs. The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears. There's still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed off yet. If you were ever yourself, and this sadness was yours, you and your sadness were all for Rosaline. And now you've changed? Then repeat this after me: you can't expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable.

You scolded me often for loving Rosaline.

A gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

An he speak any thing against me, I'll take him down, an he were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills.

What she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind ofbehavior, as they say.

The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse, In half an hour she promised to return. Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so. Oh, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams, Driving back shadows over louring hills. 
Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw love And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Ofthis day's journey, and from nine till twelve Is three long hours, yet she is not come. Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She would be as swift in motion as a ball. My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me. But old folks, many feign as they were dead, Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.

I sent the Nurse at nine 0'clock. Maybe she can't find him. That can't be. Oh, she's slow! Love's messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams. They should be strong enough to push shadows over the dark hills. That's the way doves carry Venus so fast, and that's why Cupid has wings that let him fly as fast as the wind. Now it's noon. That's three hours since nine o'clock, but she hasn't come back. If she was young and passionate, she'd move as fast as a ball. My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me. But a lot of old people act like they're already dead-sluggish, slow, fat, and colorless, like lead.

ROMEO 
Amen, amen. But come what sorrow can, 
Itcannot countervail the exchange ofjoy 
That one short minute gives me in her sight. 
Do thou but close our hands with holy words, 
Then love-devouring death do what he dare; 
It is enough I may but call her mine. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey Is loathsome in his own deliciousness And in the taste confounds the appetite . Therefore love moderately. Long love doth so. Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. 
Enter JULIET, somewhat fast, and embraceth ROMEO

FRIAR LAWRENCE 
These sudden joys have sudden endings. They burn up in victory like fire and gunpowder. When they meet, as in a kiss, they explode. Too much honey is delicious, but it makes you sick to your stomach. Therefore, love each other in moderation. That is the key to long-lasting love. Too fast is as bad as too slow.

Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford No better term than this: thou art a villain. 
ROMEO 
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee 
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage 
To such a greeting. Villain am I none. 
Therefore, farewell. I see thou know'st me not.

We're talking here in a public place. Either go some­place private, or talk it over rationally, or else just go away. Out here everybody can see us. 
Men's eyes were made to see things, so let them watch. I won't move to please anybody.

Romeo, there's only one thing I can call you. You're a villain.

Good King ofCats, nothing but one ofyour nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest ofthe eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.

This calm submission is dishonorable and vile. The thrust of a sword will end this surrender. (draws his sword)Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you go fight me? 
What do you want from me? 
Good King of Cats, I want to take one of your nine lives. I'll take one, and, depending on how you treat me after that, I might beat the other eight out of you too. Will you pull your sword out ofits sheath? Hurry up, or I'll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn.

Your high displeasure. All this uttered 
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed, 
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen 
OfTybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts 
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast, 
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point, 
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats 
Cold death aside and with the other sends 
Itback to Tybalt, whose dexterity, 
Retorts it. Romeo, he cries aloud, 
"Hold, friends! Friends, part!" and, swifter than his 
tongue, 
His agile arm beats down their fatal points, 
And 'twixt them rushes-underneath whose arm 
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life 
Ofstout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.

Where are the evil men who started this fight? 
Oh, noble prince, I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight. Over there Tybalt is lying dead. He killed your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young Romeo killed him. 
LADY CAPULET 
PRINCE 
BENVOLIO 
Tybalt was my nephew! He was my brother's son! Oh Prince, oh nephew, oh husband! Oh, my nephew is dead! Oh Prince, as you are a man of honor, take revenge for this murder by killing someone from the Montague family. Oh cousin, cousin! 
Benvolio, who started this fight? 
Tybalt started the fight before he was killed by Romeo. Romeo spoke to Tybalt politely and told him how silly this argument was. He mentioned that you would not approve ofthe fight. He said all ofthis gen­tly and calmly, kneeling down out of respect. But he could not make peace with Tybalt, who was in an angry mood and wouldn't listen to talk about peace. Tybalt and Mercutio began to fight each other fiercely, lunging at one another and dodging each other's blows. Romeo cried out, "Stop, my friends. Break it up." Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down. But Tybalt reached under Romeo's arm and thrust his sword into brave Mercutio. Then Tybalt fled the scene.

But by and by comes back to Romeo, Who had but newly entertained revenge, And to 't they go like lightning, for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain. And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. 
LADY CAPULET 
He is a kinsman to the Montague. Affection makes him false. He speaks not true. Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, And all those twenty could but kill one life. I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give . Romeo slew Tybalt. Romeo must not live. 
PRINCE 
Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio. Who now the price ofhis dear blood doth owe? 
MONTAGUE 
Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio's friend. His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life ofTybalt. 
PRINCE 
And for that offence Immediately we do exile him hence. I have an interest in your hearts' proceeding. My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding. But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine. I will be deaf to pleading and excuses. Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses, Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he's found, that hour is his last. Bear hence this body and attend our will. Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

But pretty soon he came back to meet Romeo, who was overcome with the desire for revenge. As quick as lightning, they started fighting. Before I could break up the fight, Tybalt was killed. Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead. I'm telling you the truth, I swear on my life. 
LADY CAPULET 
Benvolio is part ofthe Montague family. His loyalties to the Montagues make him tell lies. He's not telling the truth. There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot, and together those twenty could only kill one man. I demand justice. You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice. Romeo killed Tybalt. Romeo must die. 
PRINCE 
Romeo killed Tybalt. Tybalt killed Mercutio. Who should now pay the price for Mercutio's life? 
MONTAGUE 
Not Romeo, Prince. He was Mercutio's friend. His crime did justice's job by taking Tybalt's life. 
PRINCE 
And for that crime, Romeo is hereby exiled from Verona. I'm involved in your rivalry. Mercutio was my relative, and he lies dead because of your bloody feud. I'll punish you so harshly that you'll regret caus­ing me this loss. I won't listen to your pleas or excuses. You can't get out of trouble by praying or crying, so don't bother. Tell Romeo to leave the city immedi­ately, or else, ifhe is found, he will be killed. Take away this body, and do what I say. Showing mercy by par­doning killers only causes more murders.

As Phaeton would whip you to the west 
And bring in cloudy night immediately. 
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, 
That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo 
Leap to these arms, untalked of and unseen. 
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites 
By their own beauties, or, iflove be blind, 
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night, 
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, 
And learn me how to lose a winning match 
Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods. 
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks, 
With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold, 
Think true love acted simple modesty. 
Come, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in night, 
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night 
Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back. 
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-browed night, 
Give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, 
Take him and cut him out in little stars, 
And he will make the face of heaven so fine 
That all the world will be in love with night 
And pay no worship to the garish sun. 
Oh, I have bought the mansion of a love, 
But not possessed it, and though I am sold, 
Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day 
As is the night before some festival 
To an impatient child that hath new robes

I wish night would come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity. Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed. In the darkness, let me, a shy virgin, learn the strange act of sex so that it seems innocent, modest, and true. Come, night. Come, Romeo. You're like a day that comes during the night. You're whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven. Come, gentle night. Come, loving, dark night. Give me my Romeo. And when I die, turn him into stars and form a constellation in his image.

Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin? 
Am I supposed to say bad things about my own hus­band? Ah, my poor husband, who will sing your praises when I, your wife of three hours, have been saying awful things about you? But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin? Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband. I'm not going to cry any tears. I would cry with joy that Romeo is alive, but I should cry tears ofgrief because Tybalt is dead. My husband, whom Tybalt wanted to kill, is alive. Tybalt, who wanted to kill my husband, is dead. All this is comforting news. Why, then, should I cry? There is news worse than the news that Tybalt is dead, news that makes me want to die. I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds. "Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished."

That "banished," that one word "banished" Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death Was woe enough, if it had ended there. Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs, Why followed not, when she said "Tybalt's dead," "Thy father" or "thy mother," nay, or both, Which modern lamentations might have moved? But with a rearward following Tybalt's death, "Romeo is banished." To speak that word, Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, All slain, all dead. "Romeo is banished." There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, In that word's death. No words can that woe sound. Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?

He made you for a highway to my bed, But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed. Come, cords.-Come, Nurse. I'll to my wedding bed. And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death would be bad enough if that was all. Maybe pain likes to have com­pany and can't come without bringing more pain. It would have been better if, after she said, "Tybalt's dead," she told me my mother or my father, or both, were gone. That would have made me make the nor­mal cries ofsadness. But to say that Tybalt's dead and then say, "Romeo has been banished." To say that is like saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, they're all dead. "Romeo has been banished." That news brings infinite death. No words can express the pain. Where are my father and my mother, Nurse? 
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt's corpse. Are you going to join them? I'll bring you there. 
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears? I'll cry my tears for Romeo's banishment when their tears are dry. Pick up this rope ladder. This poor rope lad­der, it's useless now, just like me, because Romeo has been exiled. He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed, but I am a virgin, and I will die a virgin and a widow. Let's go, rope ladder. Nurse, I'm going to lie in my wedding bed. And death, not Romeo, can take my virginity! 
Go to your bedroom. I'll find Romeo to comfort you. I know where he is. Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight. I'll go to him. He's hiding out in Friar Lawrence's cell.

FRIAR LAWRENCE 
You know too much about suffering. I have news for you about the Prince's punishment. 
ROMEO 
Is the Prince's punishment any less awful than doomsday? 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
He made a gentler decision. You won't die, but you'll be banished from the city. 
ROMEO 
Ha, banishment? Be merciful and say "death." E~ile is much worse than death. Don't say "banishment." 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
From now on, you are banished from Verona. You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide.

There is no world for me outside the walls ofVerona, except purgatory, torture, and hell itself. So to be ban­ished from Verona is like being banished from the world, and being banished from the world is death.

Is death mistermed. Calling death "banishment," Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
o deadly sin! 0 rude unthankfulness! Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince, Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law, And turned that black word "death" to "banishment." This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. 
ROMEO 
'Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here, Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog And little mouse, every unworthy thing, Live here in heaven and may look on her, But Romeo may not. More validity, More honorable state, more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand And steal immortal blessing from her lips, Who even in pure and vestal modesty, Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin. But Romeo may not. He is banished. Flies may do this, but I from this must fly. They are free men, but I am banished. And sayst thou yet that exile is not death? Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife, No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, But "banished" to kill me?-"Banished"! 
o Friar, the damned use that word in hell. Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart, Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, A sin-absolver, and my friend professed, To mangle me with that word "banished"? 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.

Banishment is death by the wrong name. Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I'm being murdered. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
Oh, deadly sin! Oh, rude and unthankful boy! You committed a crime that is punishable by death, but our kind Prince took sympathy on you and ignored the law when he substituted banishment for death. This is kind mercy, and you don't realize it. 
ROMEO 
It's torture, not mercy. Heaven is here because Juliet lives here. Every cat and dog and little mouse, every unworthy animal that lives here can see her, but Romeo can't. Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo. They can take hold of Juliet's wonderful white hand and they can kiss her sweet lips. Even while she remains a pure virgin, she blushes when her lips touch each other because she thinks it's a sin. But Romeo can't kiss her or hold her hand because he's been banished. Flies can kiss her, but I must flee the city. Flies are like free men, but I have been banished. And yet you say that exile is not death? Did you have no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment? Oh Friar, damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell. They howl about banishment. If you're a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you say you're my friend, how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?

Wilt thou slay thyself, And slay thy lady that in thy life lives By doing damned hate upon thyself? Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose? Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit, Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit. Thy noble shape is but a form ofwax, Digressing from the valor of a man; Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish; Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, Misshapen in the conduct ofthem both, Like powder in a skill-less soldier's flask, Is set afire by thine own ignorance; And thou dismembered with thine own defence. What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive, For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead­There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slew'st Tybalt-there art thou happy.

Hold on, and don't act out of desperation. Are you a

look like a woman. Your wild actions resemble the 
irrational fury of a beast. You're a shameful woman 
who looks like a man or else an ugly creature who's 
half-man, half-beast. You have amazed me. I swear by 
my holy order, I thought you were smarter and more 
rational than this. Have you killed Tybalt? Will you 
kill yourself? And would you also kill your wife, who 
shares your life, by committing the sin ofkilling your­
self? Why do you complain about your birth, the 
heavens, and the earth? Life is the union of soul in 
body through the miracle of birth, but you would 
throw all that away. You bring shame to your body, 
your love, and your mind. You have so much natural 
talent, but like someone who hoards money, you use 
none of your talent for the right purpose-not your 
body, not your love, not your mind. Your body is just 
a wax figure, without the honor ofa man.Thelove that 
you promised was a hollow lie. You're killing the love 
that you vowed to cherish. Your mind, which aids 
both your body and your love, has mishandled both of 
them. You're like a stupid soldier whose gunpowder 
explodes because he's careless. The things you were 
supposed to use to defend yourself end up killing you. 
Getup, maniYour Juliet is alive. It was for her that you 
were almost killed earlier. Be happy that she's alive. 
Tybalt wanted to kill you, but you killed Tybalt. Be 
happy that you're alive. The law that threatened your 
life was softened into exile. Be happy about that. Your 
life is full ofblessings. You have the best sorts ofhap­

Come you to make confession to this Father?

To answer that, I should confess to you.

PARIS 
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. 
JULIET 
IfI do so, it will be ofmore price Being spoke behind your back than to your face. 
PARIS 
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears. 
JULIET 
The tears have got small victory by that, For it was bad enough before their spite. 
PARIS 
Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report. 
JULIET 
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth, And what I spake, I spake it to my face. 
PARIS 
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.

You will also confess, I'm sure, that you love me. 
JULIET 
If! do so, it will mean more if! say it behind your back than if I say it to your face. 
PARIS 
You poor soul, your face has suffered many tears. 
JULIET 
The tears haven't done much because my face looked bad enough before I started to cry. 
PARIS 
You're treating your face even worse by saying that. 
JULIET 
What I say isn't slander, sir. It's the truth. And what I said, I said to my face. 
PARIS 
Your face is mine, and you have slandered it.

God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion! Juliet, I will wake you early on Thursday. (kissing her) Until then, good-bye, and keep this holy kiss.

Oh, shut the door, and after you shut it, come over here and weep with me. This mess is beyond hope, beyond cure, beyond help!

Oh, Juliet, I already know about your sad situation. It's a problem too hard for me to solve. I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday, and that nothing can delay it. 
JULIET 
Don't tell me that you've heard about this marriage, Friar, unless you can tell me how to prevent it. Ifyou who are so wise can't help, please be kind enough to call my solution wise. (she shows him a knife) And I'll solve the problem now with this knife. God joined my heart to Romeo's. You joined our hands. And before I-who was married to Romeo by you-am married to another man, I'll kill myself. You are wise and you have so much experience. Give me some advice about the current situation. Or watch. Caught between these two difficulties, I'll act like a judge with my bloody knife. I will truly and honorably resolve the situation that you can't fix, despite your experience and education. Don't wait long to speak. I want to die ifwhat you say isn't another solution.

FRIAR LAWRENCE 
Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry County Paris, Thou hast the strength ofwill to slay thyself, Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame, That copest with death himself to 'scape from it. An ifthou darest, I'll give thee remedy. 
JULIET 
.' 0, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, From off the battlements ofyonder tower; Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears; Or shut me nightly in a charnel house, O'ercovered quite with dead men's rattling bones, With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls; Or bid me go into a new-made grave And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble­And I will do it without fear or doubt, To live an unstained wife to my sweet love. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
Hold, then. Go home, be merry. Give consent To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow. Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone. Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.

Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilled liquor drink thou off, When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humor, for no pulse Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.

FRIAR LAWRENCE 
Hold on, daughter, I see some hope. But we must act boldly because the situation is so desperate. Ifyou've made up your mind to kill yourself instead of marry­ing Count Paris, then you'll probably be willing to try something like death to solve this shameful problem. You can wrestle with death to escape from shame. And ifyou dare to do it, I'll give you the solution. 
JULIET 
Oh, you can tell me to jump offthe battle posts ofany tower, or to walk down the crime-ridden streets of a slum. Or tell me to sit in a field full of poisonous snakes. Chain me up with wild bears. Hide me every night in a morgue full ofdead bodies with wet, smelly flesh and skulls withoutjawbones. Or tell me to climb down into a freshly dug grave, and hide me with a dead man in his tomb. All those ideas make me tremble when I hear them named. But I will do them without fear or dread in order to be a pure wife to my sweet love. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
Hold on, then. Go home, be cheerful, and tell them you agree to marry Paris. Tomorrow is Wednesday. Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone. Don't let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom. (showing her a vial) When you're in bed, take this vial, mix its contents with liquor, and drink. Then a cold, sleep­inducing drug will run through your veins, and your pulse will stop. Your flesh will be cold, and you'll stop breathing. The red in your lips and your cheeks will turn pale, and your eyes will shut. It will seem like you're dead. You won't be able to move, and your body will be stiff like a corpse. You'll remain in this deathlike state for forty-two hours, and then you'll

And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Then, as the manner of our country is, In thy best robes uncovered on the bier Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred ofthe Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come, and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.

Then, as tradition demands, you'll be dressed up in your best clothes, put in an open coffin, and carried to the Capulet fam­ily tomb. Meanwhile, I'll send Romeo word of our plan. He'll come here, and we'll keep a watch for when you wake up. That night, Romeo will take you away to Mantua. This plan will free you from the shameful sit­uation that troubles you now as long as you don't change your mind, or become scared like a silly woman and ruin your brave effort.

For he hath still been tried a holy man. 
How if, when I am laid into the tomb, 
I wake before the time that Romeo 
Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point. 
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault 
To whose foul mouth no health some air breathes in, 
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? 
Or, if! live, is it not very like 
The horrible conceit ofdeath and night, 
Together with the terror ofthe place­
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, 
Where for these many hundred years the bones 
Of all my buried ancestors are packed; 
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, 
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, 
At some hours in the night spirits resort-?

And shrieks like mandrakes torn out ofthe earth,

And yet, it shouldn't be poison because he is a trustworthy holy man. What if, when I am put in the tomb, I wake up before Romeo comes to save me? That's a frightening idea. Won't I suffo­cate in the tomb? There's no healthy air to breathe in there. Will I die of suffocation before Romeo comes? Or if! live, I'll be surrounded by death and darkness. It will be terrible. There will be bones hundreds of years old in that tomb, my ancestors' bones. Tybalt's body will be in there, freshly entombed, and his corpse will be rotting.

And all the better is it for the maid. Your part in her you could not keep from death, But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. The most you sought was her promotion, For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced. And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? Oh, in this love, you love your child so ill That you run mad, seeing that she is well. She's not well married that lives married long, But she's best married that dies married young. Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary On this fair corse, and, as the custom is, And in her best array, bear her to church. For though some nature bids us all lament, Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

She is in a better place. You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life. The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder-that was your idea of heaven. And now you cry, even though she has risen up above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? Oh, in this love, you love your child so badly, that you go mad, even though she is in heaven. It is best to marry well and die young, better than to be married for a long time. Dry up your tears, and put your rosemary on this beautiful corpse. And, in accordance with cus­tom, carry her to the church in her best clothes. It's natural for us to shed tears for her, but the truth is, we should be happy for her. 
CAPULET 
All the things that we prepared for the wedding party will now be used for the funeral. Our happy music will now be sad. Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast. Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches. Our bridal flowers will cover a bur­ied corpse. And everything will be used for the oppo­site purpose from what we intended.

My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne, And all this day an unaccustomed spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreamt my lady came and found me dead-Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think­And breathed such life with kisses in my lips That I revived and was an emperor. Ah me! How sweet is love itself possessed When but love's shadows are so rich injoy!

It's a strange dream that lets a dead man think! She came and brought me back to life by kissing my lips. I rose from the dead and was an emperor. Oh my! How sweet it it would be to actually have the woman I love, when merely thinking about love makes me so happy.

Then she is well, and nothing is wrong. Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb, and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven. I saw her buried in her family's tomb, and then I came here to tell you the news. Oh, pardon me for bringing this bad news, but you told me it was my job, sir.

Meager were his looks, Sharp misery had worn him to the bones, And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, An alligator stuffed, and other skins Ofill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds, Remnants ofpackthread and old cakes of roses, Were thinly scattered to make up a show.

He had a tortoise shell hanging up in his shop as well as a stuffed alligator and other skins of strange fish. There were a few empty boxes on his shelves, as well as green clay pots, and some musty seeds. There were a few strands ofstring and mashed rose petals on dis­play.

Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them.

You're this poor and wretched and still afraid to die? Your cheeks are thin because of hunger. I can see in your eyes that you're starving. Anyone can see that you're a beggar.

Upon thy life I charge thee, Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof, And do not interrupt me in my course. Why I descend into this bed ofdeath Is partly to behold my lady's face, But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring, a ring that I must use In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone. But ifthou, jealous, dost return to pry In what I farther shall intend to do, By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.

I'm going down into this tomb ofthe dead, partly to behold my wife's face. But my main reason is to take a precious ring from her dead finger. I must use that ring for an important pur­pose. So go on your way. But if you get curious and return to spy on me, I swear I'll tear you apart limb by limb and spread your body parts around to feed the hungry animals in the graveyard.

How often are men happy right before they die! They call it the lightness before death. Oh, how can I call this lightness? Oh, my love! My wife! Death has sucked the honey from your breath, but it has not yet ruined your beauty. You haven't been conquered. There is still red in your lips and in your cheeks. Death has not yet turned them pale. Tybalt, are you lying there in your bloody death shroud? Oh, what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young. For­give me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet, why are you still so beautiful? Should I believe that death is in love with you, and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress? I don't like that idea, so I'll stay with you. And I will never leave this tomb. Here, here I'll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids. Oh, I'll rest here forever. I'll forget about all the bad luck that has troubled me. Eyes, look out for the last time! Arms, make your last embrace! And lips, you are the doors of breath.

I married them, and their stol'n marriage day Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death Banished the new-made bridegroom from the city­For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined. You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betrothed and would have married her perforce To County Paris. Then comes she to me. And with wild looks bid me devise some mean To rid her from this second marriage. Or in my cell there would she kill herself.

FRIAR LAWRENCE 
I am the greatest, but I was able to do the least. I am under the most suspicion, because I was here at the time of this awful murder. And here I stand, you can question me and punish me. I have already con­demned and excused myself. 
PRINCE 
Tell us what you know about this affair. 
FRIAR LAWRENCE 
I will be brief because I'm not going to live long enough to tell a boring story. Romeo, who lies there dead, was the husband ofthatJuliet. And she, who lies there dead, was that Romeo's faithful wife. I married them; their secret wedding day was the day Tybalt died. His untimely death caused the bridegroom to be banished from the city. Juliet was sad because Romeo was gone, not because ofTybalt's death. To cure her sadness, you arranged a marriage for her with Count Paris. Then she came to me, and, looking wild, she asked me to devise a plan to get her out ofthis second marriage. She threatened to kill herself in my cell if I didn't help her. So I gave her a sleeping potion that I had mixed with my special skills. It worked as planned. She seemed to everyone to be dead.

Meantime I writ to Romeo, That he should hither come as this dire night, To help to take her from her borrowed grave, Being the time the potion's force should cease. But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stayed by accident, and yesternight Returned my letter back. Then all alone At the prefixed hour ofher waking Came I to take her from her kindred's vault, Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo, But when I came, some minute ere the time Ofher awakening, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. She wakes, and I entreated her come forth, And bear this work ofheaven with patience. But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, And she, too desperate, would not go with me, But, as it seems, did violence on herself. All this I know, and to the marriage Her Nurse is privy. And ifaught in this Miscarried by my fault, let myoId life Be sacrificed some hour before his time Unto the rigor of severest law.

But the man who carried my letter, Friar} ohn, was held up by an accident. Last night he gave me the let­ter back. So I came here alone at the hour when she was supposed to wake up. I came to take her out of her family's tomb, hoping to hide her in my cell until I could make contact with Romeo. But by the time I got here, just a few minutes before Juliet woke up, Paris and Romeo were already dead. She woke up, and I asked her to come out ofthe tomb with me and endure this tragedy with patience. But then a noise sent me running scared from the tomb. She was too desperate to come with me, and it seems that she killed herself. I know all of this. And her Nurse knows about the marriage too. Ifany part ofthis tragedy is my fault, let myoid life be sacrificed and let me suffer the most severe punishment. 
PRINCE 
We have always known you to be a holy man. Where's Romeo's man? What does he have to say about this? 
BALTHASAR

Give me the letter. I'll look at it. (he takes the letter from BALTHASAR) Where is the count's page, the one who called the watch? Boy, what was your master doing here? 
He came with flowers to spread on his lady's grave. And he asked me to stand far away and leave him alone, and so I did. Then someone with a torch came to open the tomb. So my master drew on him. And then I ran away to call the watch. 
(skimming the letter) This letter confirms the friar's account. It describes the course oftheir love and men­tions the news of her death. Here he writes that he bought poison from a poor pharmacist. He brought that poison with him to this vault to die and lie with Juliet. Where are these enemies? Capulet! Montague! Do you see what a great evil results from your hate? Heaven has figured out how to kill your joys with love. Because I looked the other way when your feud flared up, I've lost several members of my family as well. Everyone is punished. 
Oh, brother Montague, give me your hand. This is my daughter's dowry. I can ask you for nothing more. 
But I can give you more. I'll raise her statue in pure gold. As long as this city is called Verona, there will be no figure praised more than that of true and faithful Juliet.

The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head, 
Go hence, to have more talk ofthese sad things. 
Some shall be pardoned, and some punished.

Than this ofJuliet and her Romeo.
